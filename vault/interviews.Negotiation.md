General rules to follow:
- when they give offer, thank and ask **straight away** whether it is negotiable - sets expectations that you need more.
- use closing deal quickly to get raises, i.e. say I would stop interviewing if you offer x
- always show interest in the company, pravene na nedostupen is 5th grade
- competing offers always help...
- you need to click with the recruiter
- search for opportunities to have casual chats/laughs
- try to create a friendly chit chat atmosphere
- money talks should sound casual as if you are just chatting
- delay salary negotiation as late as possible in the interview process
- probation period salary x, if successful salary 1.3x ?
- set three numbers in your head, min, mid, max
- set your goals - what you want...
- **whenever you ask for increase you need to show interest in working for the company!**
They should not feel as if you are just using them to get counter offers

## Smarkets

week 1 - made me an offer, I asked for increase

week 3 - offered to meet in the middle of the two sides

week 4 - I showed counter offer, lets see how they respond

They do not seem do be in a hurry so harder to close deal using the time argument. Now I got competing offer and will use that.

## Yelp
week 0 - asked for expectations

week 1- made me offer which is below my expectations by 10k. I asked if they can make a raise

They gave me 1 week deadline, a bit pushy in my opinion. Not sure if they are in a hurry or not. They seem keen to hire me as gave me IC3 level.

Tasks:
- say what your numbers in base are for which you can settle straight away


## Capital One
week 1 made me offer. I asked for 20% bump and said would stop other interviews and they did offer me that bump. Closed deal.
