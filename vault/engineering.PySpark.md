PySpark is a Python API that allows you to use the power of Apache Spark - fast & scalable big data processing system.
- you write Python code
- PySpark lets tat code run on many computers at once (a "cluster")
- analyze, process and transform huge datasets that would not fit on a single computer's memory
- distributed processing - distribute the data in multiple computers and splits up the work
- supports Pandas like code + SQL queries

# Optimizations


- cache initialized data. Whenever you reuse a dataframe in a for loop 
```python
 
```
