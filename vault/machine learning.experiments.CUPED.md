# What is CUPED?

CUPED is a well-established variance reduction technique for experiments (paper).

Unlike methods like outlier removal or winsorization, it doesnâ€™t sacrifice any data integrity.

It can be used together with winsorization, which enhances its effectiveness.

It requires pre-experimentation data - which we generally have in Bunsen.

For a rather unpredictable event like ad clicks, we get ~5% reduction in standard deviation (which is ~10% reduction in variance, and experiment run time). For something like sessions, that 5% can increase to something like 30%.



# Predicted uncertainty is not uncertainty. 

So the variance in your experiment metric should only take into account the unpredictable part of your measurement. If you predict that:
- guv A will have 5 sessions during the experiment, and 
- guv B will have 20 sessions,

And when you actually measure the sessions, you get:
- guv A has 4 sessions (-1 from prediction)
- guv B has 21 sessions (+1 from prediction),

Then the variance, or the uncertainty, in your measurement can be calculated on the residuals of your predictions, rather than on the measurements themselves. This gives var([-1, +1]), rather than var([4, 21]), which is a great reduction.
