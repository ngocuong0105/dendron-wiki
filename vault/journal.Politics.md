# Inflation
Countries always want small inflation in their currency. Inflation -> more expert than import = good. Export = stuff you sell,
Import = stuff you buy. You want more sell than buy. If you currency is very expensive with no inflation, you will only import.

# Socialism vs Capitalism
Market demand should drive what type of market is better. Healthcare should be social, government should participate in that
market because demand for health is distributed uniformly. Probability of rich and poor people get cancer is relatively
the same. For sports cars market should be capitalism. P(rich person buys lambo) >> P(poor person buys lambo).


# BBR (bg bank za razvitie)
Should that be privatized?

# When a company should go public?

# Euro funds and government subsidiaries

# Investing

# Fitness and health
It is not expensive (time-wise and money-wise) to become nacepen. You basically pay fixed cost first 2 months to get nacepen,
then you need to pay small regular costs (2,3 times per week). Gym helps me to be more productive when working too. My most efficient
work periods have always been when I go to gym regularly too. So it is worth it. Abs is all about diet.


# Thoughts on diversity and inclusion


# Should we support in-country made stuff?
