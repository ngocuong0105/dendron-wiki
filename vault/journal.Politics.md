# Inflation
Countries always want small inflation in their currency. Inflation -> more expert than import = good. Export = stuff you sell,
Import = stuff you buy. You want more sell than buy. If you currency is very expensive with no inflation, you will only import.

# Socialism vs Capitalism
Market demand should drive what type of market is better. Healthcare should be social, government should participate in that
market because demand for health is distributed uniformly. Probability of rich and poor people get cancer is relatively
the same. For sports cars market should be capitalism. P(rich person buys lambo) >> P(poor person buys lambo).


Markets where there should be government intervention:
- health
- education?

# What should governments do?

- protect borders
- enforce laws equally
- create laws
- make business environment better
- take care of poorest people? Maybe with small amount of taxes.
- justice system
- infrastructure? Not sure about this one. Building towns and roads can be done by private sector I think.

Should the government play any social part in people's life? The more responsibilities a government has, the less freedom
individual people have. Therefore I think government should not do social politics at all. Social politics is a fancy term for taking money from the ones who have money to the ones who do not have money. That is the core of social politics. It takes money from those who work and gives it to those who don't.

# When a company should go public?

# Euro funds and government subsidiaries

# Investing
Look for opportunities when people are afraid to invest, do not invest when everybody is doing that. Now the stock markets have crashed by quite a bit (July 2022), I think I should put some money on this.

Housing market is crazy, peak after peak. It feels it slows down a bit and we might reach a downturn. For my personal finances I would have enough money to get in the market after 2-3 years. Let's see if there is a downturn...



# Thoughts on diversity and inclusion


# Should we support in-country made stuff?



# Reform the justice system thoughts

- from state to private prosecutors will lead to less corrupted prosecutors
- judges have to be chosen by the state? The state enforces law after all. How to fix corrupted judges? Transparency. Live stream all judge decisions.
- we need to give incentives for judges (chosen by the state) to give fair verdicts if high level politicians are being executed

# Reform the pension scheme

- receiving a pension should be **volunatary** act rather than mandatory one
- if you want pension you pay national insurance taxes, if you don't you don't pay these
- the pension system is broken because it has unlimited supply of income coming from regular insurance taxes. It does not need to be optimized and managed well because it cannot go bankrupt. The fear of failing and going bankrupt is what drives businesses and organizations to move forward. Death is inevitable in every meaningful life. We need to let the broken pension system to either die and build a new one or let it recover. But we need to put in on the free market with voluntary taxes. Then it will receive money only if it can assure the society that it will pay good pensions/provide good service for these taxes.



# BBR (bg bank za razvitie)
Should that be privatized?


# PP vs DB
PP are a bit left populists (e.g 'Use right instruments' for left ideas). However, they have strong leadership. DB match
my political views the best among all parties but have weak leadership. Hristo Ivanov is a good politician but his best role
in a party is to be an advisor rather than leader. He is a bit 'filosof'. I am happy he recently proposed wide coalition between them and PP and all the right centrist 'city' parties/community.

PP have shown several times that are good negotiators and able to group different peoples in one place. Is that true though?
In the coalition of 4 parties BSP, PP, ITN, DB, BSP has been able to push for many of their leftist ideas. PP put a cap
price on electricity in Jan 2022. THat's super weird move and I doubt they teach this stuff in Harvard Business School.

DB has been quite consistent with their promises to the people (except being in coalition with BSP). They have pushed for
justice reform, e-government, low taxes and fighting against corruption. I am pleased with what they've done. I hope
PP would agree to have pre-election coalition with them.

# Are BSP less corrupted as of 2022?

It is very controversial to see PP, ITN and DB to agree to be in coalition with BSP. All these 3 parties have talked against
BSP to some extend or another. Does that mean BSP are less corrupted now or political parties just need their votes and
become corrupted as well? I think it is pretty hard to determine if a party is corrupted anyways. PP, ITN and DB do not
most probably do not know if BSP is corrupted. They are for sure much less corrupted than 15 years ago when they were in
power. What, I admire about BSP is that they have very consistent political views and have clearly identified them in the
political and economical spectrum. I do not agree with their views but respect that they stay consistent. I am definitely not
happy that they have seats in the government but what can we do?

# Government 2nd Aug 2022.

New government by president Radev (3rd in the last year and a half). Tis one is a bit communist, pro-Russia and do not have all stars like Kiril and Asen. Seems not competent too. Radev made some really good moves with bringing Asen and Kiril and riding the protests wave in summer 2021. Now he seems to have deviated from this direction and is more pro-Russia. Like ITN it looks like everybody is fighting for themselves.
