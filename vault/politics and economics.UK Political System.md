## Elections

**General elections**
A general election is an opportunity for people in every part of the UK to choose their MP - the person who will represent their local area (constituency) in the House of Commons for up to five years.

UK elections: First-past-the post voting system on local level.

UK has 650 constinuencies, each represented by one MP. London has 73 constituencies.


**First-past-the-post voting system**: The candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins and becomes the MP for that seat. Usually, the winning candidate would have less than half of the votes (problem of this voting system).

Smaller parties don't stand a chance. Often you can get 15% of the total vote but get only 1 MP.

BG elections: Proportional representation on national level.
