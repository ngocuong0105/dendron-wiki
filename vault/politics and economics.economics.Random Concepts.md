Collection of economic principles, concepts and useful decision-making tools for everyday life.

# Opportunity cost

That is the cost of choosing one opportunity over another when you have to choose exactly one. Opporunity cost = Net return option A - Net return option B.

Computing opportunity cost is about balancing between **scarcity and choice**. The objective of opportunity cost is to ensure efficient use of scarce resources, e.g. time.

# Sunk cost

Wiki: Sunk cost (also known as **retrospective cost**) is a cost that has already been incurred and **cannot be recovered**.

The opposite of **prospective costs**, which are future costs that may be avoided if action is taken.

**In other words, a sunk cost is a sum paid in the past that is no longer relevant to decisions about the future.**

Idioms:
- water under the bridge
- crying over spilt milk

Only **current alternatives** matter. Example is in poker when you compute pot-odds. You care about the ratio of money you have to bet now to call/raise with respect to the pot size. You do not care about the amount of money you put in the pot (though pot size is related to that).


Closely related to **DESIRE NOT TO APPEAR WASTEFUL**.

## Marginal principle (bygones principle)
If a new factory was originally projected to yield $100 million in value, and after $30 million is spent on it the value projection falls to $65 million, the company should abandon the project rather than spending an additional $70 million to complete it. Conversely, as a rational actor, if the value projection falls to $75 million the company should continue the project.

Obviously, sunk costs are bad and should be minimized.

## Identifying sunk cost

Ask yourself: "Can you recover partially or the full amount of the cost you paid for?"

- Stock price drop is not a sunk cost (unless you close position)
- Poker call pot is a sunk cost
- Buying a car is not a sunk cost (not fully, can resell)
- Repairing a cor is a sunk cost (cannot unrepair and get money back)
