# Progress
My first ever submission in leetcode was on 8th of January 2021. Did some Hackerrank for 2-3 months before that as I did
not know how to code (found it hard to press quickly stuff on the keyboard...). Started leetcoding more seriously mid Feb
2021 and have been doing it for 1.5 years so far (24 Jul 2022). Current leetcode count is solved 1526 problems. Main progress
stages were:
- first 3 months good learning curve Feb-Apr, but copy-pasted lost of solutions and failed to solve most of the problems alone. Got good progress on easy questions, mediums were very hard for me, hard were impossible.
- May rested a bit and slowed down the leetcoding
- June - August great learning curve, started to solve confidently easy questions, working way through medium alone. Hard
questions are still impossible to solve alone, but can understand solutions
- Sep - Dec stayed put and interviewed at companies so was chilling leetcode and tried to keep up the pace
- (2022) Feb - July: great learning curve, confidently solved easy and mediums. Started making progress on hards and for
some I am able to do by myself. Had one hard asked during interview and managed to finish in 40 minutes with working solution.

In summary: for now I am on descent coding level for interviews. For competitive programming, its another story... In leetcode I manged to be in top 2% with 2000+ rating, but in codeforces I would be blown out by those guys.

23.07.2022
Went to my 21st competition. Solved 3/4 questions. The last one was hard level but it was super easy if you could get the idea. SUPER easy. I kind of gave up when saw that is hard level and there was big mental barrier. I should work on removing this mental barrier from my head. This increases significantly my chances of solving the question.
I lost 22 points in rating after the competition (2020 points now). Messed up one of the previous questions as well and got time penalties. Overall, I underperformed.


# Plans for the future
Ideally I would become a descent competitive programmer by 1-2 years. Need to:
- do more leetcode competitions
- learn more advanced topics in CLRS
- take the MIT advance courses for algorithms and data structures
- learn C++
- start codeforces
- join Google/Facebook coding jams
