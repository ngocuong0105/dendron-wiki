# Progress
My first ever submission in leetcode was on 8th of January 2021. Did some Hackerrank for 2-3 months before that as I did
not know how to code (found it hard to press quickly stuff on the keyboard...). Started leetcoding more seriously mid Feb
2021 and have been doing it for 1.5 years so far (24 Jul 2022). Current leetcode count is solved **1526** problems. Main progress
stages were:
- first 3 months good learning curve Feb-Apr, but copy-pasted lost of solutions and failed to solve most of the problems alone. Got good progress on easy questions, mediums were very hard for me, hard were impossible.
- May rested a bit and slowed down the leetcoding
- June - August great learning curve, started to solve confidently easy questions, working way through medium alone. Hard
questions are still impossible to solve alone, but can understand solutions
- Sep - Dec stayed put and interviewed at companies so was chilling leetcode and tried to keep up the pace
- (2022) Feb - July: great learning curve, confidently solved easy and mediums. Started making progress on hards and for
some I am able to do by myself. Had one hard asked during interview and managed to finish in 40 minutes with working solution.

In summary: for now I am on descent coding level for interviews. For competitive programming, its another story... In leetcode I manged to be in top 2% with 2000+ rating, but in codeforces I would be blown out by those guys.


**23.07.2022**

Went to my 21st competition. Solved 3/4 questions. The last one was hard level but it was super easy if you could get the idea. SUPER easy. I kind of gave up when saw that is hard level and there was big mental barrier. I should work on removing this mental barrier from my head. This increases significantly my chances of solving the question.
I lost 22 points in rating after the competition (2020 points now). Messed up one of the previous questions as well and got time penalties. Overall, I underperformed.


**08.10.2022**

Had 3 bad compatitions and lost a bit of rating. Last competiton went good - solved 4 problems under an hour and got rank around 600. Now rating is 2037. I started doing USACO and am currently in bronze division (easies one). Competitive programming problems seem much harder than leetcode. Some questions in bronze are diffficult,though most of them I am able to solve. But CP is whole another level compared with leetcoding.
Overall last two months I have been doing standard and a bit more hards unseen problems on leetcode and started competitive programming. Leetcode $\neq$ CP. In future I would probably need to learn C++, as Python code is sloooow. Also ordered a Leetcode pack (7800 leetcoins). It is flying from China to here!
I am more confident in solving hard questions in Leetcode now - say 5.5/10. Easy I am 10/10, medium I am 8.5/10.
Current leetcode count **1743** (08.10.2022)

**30.10.2022**

My best competition performance was yesterday - rank 125 on Biweekly 90. Today I hit new milestone **1800** Leetcode problems solved.


**20.01.2023**

Last year in December I hit the **2000** problems solved mark. Now I solve Leetcode casually and focus more on Kaggle.


**09.02.2023**

Hit another milestone of **2100** problems solved. **Two years of Leetcode.**

**26.02.2023**

Hit another milestone of **2200** problems solved.

**03.03.2023**

Solved all easy questions in leetcode and hit another milestone of **2300** problems solved. BG NAD VSICHKO

**06.06.2023**
Hit another milestone of **2405** problems solved. Only hard questions are left :(. 

**26.06.2023**
Hit another milestone of **2500** problems solved.

**07.09.2023**
Hit another milestone of **2600** problems solved.


# Tracking Leetcode Competitions

- Goal is to become **Guardian rating**


## Weekly Contest 416

- 30/10/2024
- Solved all 4 problems (with help for the last 2)
**What I learned?**
- Last two problems were sliding window dictionary
- In order to solve this problem you really had to go through examples with hand
- Before you write code, you better go thorugh examples with hand. When you rush into coding it actually becomes slowe




## Weekly Contest 414

Solved all 4 problems. 

**What I learned?**
- Problem 3 [3282](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-414/problems/reach-end-of-array-with-max-score/)
- Play around with example without looking at the expectedoutput. Just do it by yourself! Do no spoil the answer!
- This way you will likely try out the wrong path and understand the logic for going through the correct path
- In hindsight the problem looked like a DP, but in the end you were able to solve it using greedy. Often when problem constraints do not allow DP just think of Greedy approach

- Problem 4 [3283](https://leetcode.com/contest/weekly-contest-414/problems/maximum-number-of-moves-to-kill-all-pawns/)
- Two way DP function, where each DP depends on the other DP
- Often can see this in game theory problems with two players
- bitmasking, and just believe in yourself especially for problem 4
- the proper mindset will help you push through


# Plans for the future
Ideally I would become a descent competitive programmer in 1-2 years (written in August 2022). Need to:
- do more leetcode competitions
- learn more advanced topics in CLRS
- take the MIT advance courses for algorithms and data structures
- learn C++
- start codeforces
- join Google/Facebook coding jams


## Weekly Contest 415

Solved only 2 problems. 

**What I learned?**

- Problem 3 [3291](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-valid-strings-to-form-target-i/description/)
- I learned how to implement a trie without adding a new class but just using a dictonary.
- I learned how to adhoc traverse the trie while I was solving the dp
- I learned in order to traverse the trie on demand it was important how to define the dp problem and its subspace/subproblems
- I learned that dp problems with string can be solved forward and backwards and they will result in different order of travering the problems. It turned out that going from right to left is better ad I could traverse the trie on demand character by character


- Problem 4 [3292](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-valid-strings-to-form-target-ii/description/)
- I learned that KMP aaplication is ussually not obvious. You need to think a bit to reach to it
- KMP returns an array that tells you 'what is the longest preffix that is also a suffix'
