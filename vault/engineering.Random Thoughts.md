# Getting in the zone with Pomodoro

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.



There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x
4. Take a short break (3–5 minutes)
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes)
