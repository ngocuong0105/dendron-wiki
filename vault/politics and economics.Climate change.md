# Fossil fuel = изкопаеми горива

Coal is called a fossil fuel because it was made from plants that were once alive! Since coal comes from plants, and plants get their energy from the sun, the
energy in coal also came from the sun. The coal we use today took millions of years to form. We can’t make more in a short time. That is why coal is called nonrenewable.


Burning coal was easier because coal burned longer than wood and, therefore, did not have to be collected as often. People began using coal in the 1800s to
heat their homes. Trains and ships used coal for fuel. Factories used coal to make iron and steel. Today, we burn coal mainly to make electricity.


Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas we all produce when we breathe. However, burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy makes a lot of extra CO2. Too much CO2 in the air can trap heat, causing global warming.

Scientists are working on ways to capture CO2 from power plants before it goes into the air. They want to store it deep underground or in the ocean to prevent it from adding to climate change. This process is called carbon capture and storage, or carbon sequestration.

Even though we still use a lot of coal and other fossil fuels for energy, capturing CO2 from power plants could help fight climate change. Scientists are researching these methods to make sure they are safe for the environment, so we can continue using energy without harming our planet.
