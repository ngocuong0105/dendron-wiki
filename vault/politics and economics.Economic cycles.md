# How The Economic Machine Works

Super useful [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0&t=606s) with basic concepts on how the economy works.

## What is Economy?

The Economy is the set of all transactions in the market. A transactions is the exchange of money with goods or services. **Each transactions is one person's spending and another person's income.** Hence total spend in one country is the total income in that country.


## What is Credit?

Credit is just an IOU. It is a promise that one person makes to another. **Credit is a liability to the one taking it and an asset to the one giving it.**
Rather than being a modern innovation, credit is a very primitive and fundamental economic building block. The concept of credit has been created before 
the concept of money. Types of credit:

- car loan (liability)
- mortgage (liability), but you can get asset if you give a rent contract
- shares (asset)
- savings account (asset)
- work contract: you work now, the company promises to pay you in the end of the month (asset if you are employee)
- rent contract: you pay now, the landlord promises you to provide shelter for the month (liability if you are renting)
- student loan (liability)

## Why there are economic cycles?

The reason economic cycles exist is because there is credit. In an economy with no credit there will not be any cycles. Credit allows
people to spend money now and pay back in the future. In economy with no credit thre will be no cycles. Think of your mum's and dad's lives. They have lived their whole live with no credit and their live has been relatively linear.




Economic cycles exists because there is credit!!! Spend now, pay in the future
Money is not the same as credit

In economy with no credit increase in spend can be done only with increase with money/income increase with productivity

In economy with credit increase in spend can be done using credit (created out from thin air)

Economy is the space of all transactions in the market.

Transaction is  an exchange of money with product/service.

Market is the suvkupnossta of people buying and selling peoducts/servicise.

Each persons spending is anothers person income

Higher spending leads to higher income.

Price = Total spend/Total products

MOST OF THE SPEND IS FROM CREDIT not money!

Short term debt cycle 5-8 years
The short term debt cycle is controlled mainly by the interest rates.

When credit is easily available there is an economic expansion, when it is not easily available there is a recession

when credit is cheap, total spend increases, prices increases, INFLATION

Central bank does not like inflation. They increase interest rates. Credit is expensive, less borrow, pay more for interest and total spend decreases, price decrease, DEFLATION. since one person spend is anothers person income, income decreases, economic activity decreases RECESSION.

When inflation decreases and recession is not a big problem central bank decreases interest rate. End of the short term debt cycle. Next short term debt cycle would have larger spend and larger credit. People like to push it.

When credit is easily available economy is expanding. When credit is not available the economy is contracting

Credit is a liability to a borrower and an asset to a lender.

Having many growing short term debt cycles is not sustainable and cannot continue forever.

-----Long term debt cycle----

When debt repayments become higher than income for long period of time, total spend reduces as people spend more to cover their debt.
Spend decreases, as one person's debt is another person's income, income decreases. Bank decreases interest rates and when it hits 0 and people still have large debt this is when the DEPRESSION begins. 
Identify DEPRESSION by looking at the DEBT Burden.

Then becomes the economy deleveraging, same as depression.
Less spending - Less income- Less borrowing - Less credit vicious cycle.

Very similar to recession
However, the difference is that in recession the government can decrease interest rates to stimulate more borrowing, more credit more spending.
In depression interest rates are already very low (Japan's lost decade).


During deleveraging these 4 things happen, all with the goal to reduce the debt burden:
- people, businesses and even governments cut spending to pay down their debt. I think tech is in this now
- debt restructuring and defaults(pain)
- redistribute wealth from those that have to those that have not
- bank prints money

1 does not work as if spending decreases, and one person's spend is another person's income, total income decreases and could decrease faster than debt.

2 is usually not enough measure

3 income decreases means taxes decrease. Government need to raise more money to cover costs and help the poor

4. bank prints money when interest rates are already close to 0 and there is crisis. It uses to buy financial assets and government bonds. Happened in 1930 and in 2008.

When the bank prints money. This helps only those who have financial assets!!!! and those who use stimulus programs.

The central bank prints money, and loans using bonds to the central government which then redistributes it to people in need.


Long term debt cycle

Leveraging 50 years
Deleveraging/depression 2-3 years
Reflation 7 years

Hence the term lost decade. After the reflation things are back to the same level as after 50 years of leveraging.

Deleveraging is the process of selling assets to reduce debt. Paying off your debt.

--- Takeaways---
Identify where you are in the short term cycle by looking at the interest rates.

Identify the long term cycle by looking at the debt burden. In 2008 USA had 400% debt/income ratio.

Actions during short term cycles:
- grow,  decrease, grow again decrease again
- low interest rates, high interest rates, low again. high again 
Best time to buy when interest rates are low again.
Save cash for this time.
Best time to sell when interest rates are high.

During low interest rates you need assets, during high interest rates you need cash.

Note the timeline for the short term debt cycle can be very different for different markets (per country, per city, per neighborhood, per asset)

Actions during long term cycle:

In your lifetime you'd expect to have 1 or max 2 depressions. There is only one/two VERY important action you need to take:

- if you can identify the peak or near the peak of the end of the long term debt cycle (track debt burden). SELL ASSETS
- at the end of the depression BUY ASSETS 



Worst case scenarios if you mess up:
If you buy at the peak of short term cycle, you'd be screwed for 4-5 years, after which you'd be at 0. Lost 4-5 years and then in 4-5 years you are at profit.

If you buy at the peak of the long term cycle you lose 10 years and would be in profit in 15-16 years. (example. 2008 till  2023)



Don't confuse recession with depression! Lots of people do mot act because of fear of depression.

Dont have debt rate larger than income. Debt burden will crush you.

Dont have income rise faster than productivity. You won't be competitive.

In the long term all that matters is productivity.

---------

Currency devaluation in 1970 Nixon says "In order to defend the dollar we would exchange dollar for gold only when it is in the best interest for America"

The truth was that Ameraca would have defaulted as they did not have enough gold.

This allowed to the US spend more than they earned as they could print more. 

In 1930 Roosevelt put embargo on gold too.

In both occasions this caused the stock prices to rise. As the bank could print ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘
WHENEVER THE BANK PRINTS MONEY THE VALUE OF STOCKS, COMMODITIES ASSETS RISE AND THE VALUE OF PAPER MONEY WILL FALL.

The 1920 economic boom led to the 1930 depression

the 2007 housing bubble led to the 2008 housing crash
