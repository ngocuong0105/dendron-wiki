# Greenhouse effect

The greenhouse effect is a natural process that warms the Earth's surface. It occurs when the sun's energy reaches the Earth, some of it is reflected back to space, and the rest is absorbed and re-radiated by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and prevent it from escaping back into space, similar to how a greenhouse traps heat, hence the name.

Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O), naturally exist in the Earth's atmosphere. They allow sunlight to pass through but trap heat, creating a warming effect. This process is essential for life on Earth because it keeps the planet's surface warm enough to support life.

However, human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This enhanced greenhouse effect intensifies the warming of the Earth's surface, leading to global warming and climate change.s
