# Ping from the past

Hit me like a wave. I've concealed her in my memory quietly but once I got that text, it hit me.
Hit me high and low. As she resurfaced, it brought me memories from the past. She sent me just a 
message - simple on the surface but stirred a storm inside me. I didn't expect it but deep inside me 
I know I have been waiting for it. The weirdest thing is, despite everything, I still want to do 
anything for her.

How do I feel? Mix of excitement, longing and confusion. Part of me lights up as I talked with her, 
but another part of me is cautious as it remembers the pain from the betrayal. I can feel the love
and excitement from the fact that we will see each other next week. But underneath that pull there is
something heavier: the memory of being betrayed. It echoes the past clearly as a voice that I'd never
be able to forget - reminding me the sadness, the angriness, the emotional toll and the reasons 
we broke up.

Why do I feel this way? Because betrayal does not erase love - it complicates it. Part of me wants
to make the pain worth it. To turn the sadness and pain into opportunity. To rewrite the ending and 
turn the betrayal into redemption. 


# Keeping the past in the past and setting boundaries

I've been thinking a lot since you reached out. Hearing from you brought up a lot of emotions. 
There's still a part of me that cares, but there's also a part that remembers the pain, the betrayal,
and the trust that was broken. 

I'm not angry. I'm not trying to rehash the past. But I've worked hard to heal, and 
I need to protect that progress. If you're reaching out because you genuinely want to talk — 
with honesty and clarity — I'm open to that.

But if this is just a moment of nostalgia or uncertainty, I need to step back. I can't reopen wounds 
that I've fought to close. I wish you well, truly. But I also wish peace for myself.
