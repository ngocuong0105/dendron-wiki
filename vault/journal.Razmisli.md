# Actions
These action items have arose after doing razmisli.
- define clear dream
- define passion which can bring value to other people
- find a product which you would be passionate about
- occasionally check yourself where you are compared to others ('сверявай си часовника'), e.g. blind, forums, articles, friends and family. Don't fall in the trap of just working by yourself. Competition is what drives people and opportunities.

make some good money.
- Long term, accomplish dream to own business, entrepreneur, MORE money, takiva raboti.

for the product that I would be passionate about.

---

What are my passions?
- I like solving problems, seeing the green light in coding problems makes me happy. I like maths and solving puzzle/competitive
questions. ML is interesting too, though I have not been deep in that. Need to try out Kaggle seriously. "Mnogo zuburski otgovor".

# Speeches

Steve Jobs graduation speech - [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&ab_channel=Stanford).
His three stories:
- Believe that the dots will connect

He was adopted when he was born. Six month in college he had no idea what he was doing and did not see value in it. He decided to attend classes which he was interested in! He stayed in college, just did not study what he had to. Studied calligraphy and was super interested in it. At the time of the study he had no idea how it would help him. 10 years later it came back when designing Mac. Cannot connect the dots looking forward but it all comes back! You need to believe that the dots will connect!

- Love and loss - Keep looking, don't settle

He was fired when he was 30 from his own company. He decided to start over. "Being fired from Apple was one of the best things happened to me." Started his most creative years - founded Next, Pixel, found his wife. The only thing helped him go through this period was that he knew was he loved doing. "You have to believe in your work. In order to believe in your work, you need  to love it. Don't settle!"

- Death - thinking about death makes you think 'I have noting to loose, follow your heart'

"If you live each day as if it's your last, someday you will be right." Look in the mirror and ask yourself "If today is my last day would I do this today." Many 'no-s' in a row means you need to change something.
Death is the destination we all share. Your time is limited, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you want to do - everything else is secondary.

**Stay hungry, stay foolish!**

Elon Musk: Argue from basic truths vs by analogy

Questions you should always ask/think about.

Talking with my father is super productive, I learn so much stuff about life. Topics on which I should focus:
- economics/trade he has great intuition about these stuff
- general life advices
- how to talk with people
- he is always interested in other people and naturally curious

"Make my dreams turn into a goal" - Tatyana

Prioritazing my goals drastically changed the circle of people around me. By focusing on my work and studies, I attracted the right people around me.

Whereever you go, you will follow your dream, you will speak the truth, you will be vocal, you will share your story.

"Imagine that this astronout is you. You are capable of doing everything as long as you believe it."

[Jeff Bezos in 1999](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GltlJO56S1g&t=29s&ab_channel=CNBC)

Long term I believe it is very easy to predict lots of successful companies born of the internet - with very large market caps and so on. I also believe that today, it is very hard to predict which are these companies.

If you can focus **obsessively** enough on customer experience, they you would have a good chance.

If it one thing what Amazon is about it is excessive attention to customer experience end-to-end.

In the long term there is never misaalignment in shareholder experience and customer experience.


# Oxford

I made lots of mistakes during my 4 years at uni. When I started I thought too much of myself and that I could do whatever I want. Didn't realize that the true work actually started then... I thought I did so much work at highschool and that success was 'v kurpa vurzano'. Kind of wasted first year completely and half of second year. Had some 'love' distractions which affected my study focus and was pretty bad. Basically these 'love' distractions distracted me for nearly 4 years... Super stupid from my side but well, that's it. Now in 2022 I am fully back. I think I got over the love distractions in 100% around March 2020 (covid started and was last year of uni). At that point in time I have 0 in-person and remote contact with the distraction. Felt good. Felt great.

The fact that when talking about my Oxford experience I firstly start rambling about 'love' distractions proves I wasted a fair amount of time there. It is a pity to waste Oxford years like that but whatever.

Main mistake I made during these 4 years is that I did not ave a clear and consistent study plan. I was mainly studying in Hilary and Trinity, skipped lots of classes and lectures and did not have a way to measure my progress. I did not track time/work done in almost any way. And then I got average grades and just complained..

Another mistake is I had some bad influence from toxic people. Should avoid this toxicity as much as possible!

Had a lot of procrastination too

Main mistake is I did not have a plan. Cultural plan, Studying plan, How to live independently plan, healthy lifestyle plan.

# Fitness and health

It is not expensive (time-wise and money-wise) to become nacepen. You basically pay fixed cost first 2 months to get nacepen,
then you need to pay small regular costs (2,3 times per week). Gym helps me to be more productive when working too. My most efficient work periods have always been when I go to gym regularly too. So it is worth it. Abs is all about diet.

[Garry Kasparov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RVa0THWUWw&ab_channel=LexFridman)

Fear of mistakes guarantees making mistakes.

Key in success is not fear of mistakes or love of winning. It is a passion to make a difference.

"I always think that the outcome of the game depends on my gameplay"

Machine will beat human in closed systems like chess.

[Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zOHSysMmH0&ab_channel=LexFridman)

health, loving familiy and friends, **making time for friends**

**be excited for something in the future**

need to have something you are looking forward to

# Managing your work and setting goals

You have underestimated planning and project management. For example when you started using Jira tasks, roadmap, backlog, sprints, these have increased your productivity significantly. Being able to track what you do is super important. Writing things down is highly underappreciated. Writing when and what you achive and seeing it regularly adds lots of value and helps for conistency.

Getting in FAANG has lots of learning value. Will have the chance to learn super many new stuff. Meta publishes papers every week, including in big conferences like NeurIPS.
I should aim for TC + going in such places with lots of smart people. Stefan seemed quite impressed by Meta tools and leaning stuff so it must be really good stuff.

# TC

High TC factors/variables are:
- interview skills: getting interviews + doing interviews (behaviour + technical)
- your skillset and whether you can do the job (this is important but interviewing skills are more important to get high TC)
- YOE
- market

Taka kakto za kasierka davat 2k ne zashtoto izkarva na firmata 2k+, taka v tech plashtat mn pari za gluposti.

Main TC factor is interview skills. It is similar to rising in power in democratic countries. Main skill is marketing/populism and winning elections. Other things such as economics knowldge, finance, politics, leadership, giving speeches, diplomacy are secondary. It is all about winning elections. High TC is all about cracking the interviews.

This year tech companies struggle. High interest rates means high cost to loan money.

Tech companies don't do lending. Lots of regulations, huigh buy-in.

# Communication

Conversations based on sarcasm, "vsichko e na buzik" mindset is a powerful framework. Your starting point in having conversations with people is not to think about yourself (or proving yourself), rather think that everything is a joke.
