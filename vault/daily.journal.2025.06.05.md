# Presentation Skills

7 habits that quietly kill your influence: 

- Starting with the data
- Using passive language
- Presenting 5 insights at once
- Explaining everything you did
- Assuming they remember context
- Avoiding giving a recommendation
- Using visuals that require decoding

Instead:

- Start with whatâ€™s at stake / the opportunity
- Use direct and active language (own it!)
- Present 1 idea (+ supporting evidence)
- Explain your point, not your process
- Recap context before you dig in
- Recommend a few next steps
- Use visuals that tell a story
