LP principles from Stefan are pretty good stuff. You should do your own like these.

Listen, listen, listen! Do not interrupt even if you know something - no points for saying things quickly if you interrupt.

need to prepare stories per each company

Interviewers search for signal in these domains:
- for low level just don't be asshole
- team work

- For higher levels:
- team management
- teaching other people, motivate, mentee others
- can give examples of you helping people to onboard
- contribution in refinement sessions, jira stories, defining objectives and goals
- helping people with getting started
- think of what your managers have done to help you and these are stuff that show signal that you are higher level
