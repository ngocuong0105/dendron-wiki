# Pomodoro method

Pomodoro means tomatoes in Italian

1. Make a todo-list of tasks you need to finish
2. Start pomodoro 25 minutes with 5 minutes break

Stops you from worrying about the endless tasks you need to finish, and makes you focus on the things you can get done now.


Take 15 minutes at the beginning of your workday (or at the end if youâ€™re planning for the next day) to plan out your pomodoros. Take your to-do list for the day and note how many pomodoros each task will take.

Remember, tasks that will take more than 5 pomodoros should be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Smaller tasks, like responding to emails, can be batched together in a single Pomodoro.

Get away from screen during a break. Coding tasks usually require more time to get into the zone, so you might combine pomodoros.
