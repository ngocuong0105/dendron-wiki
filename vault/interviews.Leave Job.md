Just be honest about why you are leaving. Things to mention:

- select reasons which only the new company has and your old one cannot possibly offer. E.g. relocation in city only the
new company has office in, compensation package (e.g 2x)
- say things you like about the team, be specific
- say work-wise what you would do for the transition period. Should be 50/50 split why you leave and work you would do
- ask whether you need to submit resignation letter or other documents

It's all professional, no hard feelings
