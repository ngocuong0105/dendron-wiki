It is important to consider detecting and handling outliers in your data to prevent them from negatively impacting your model. Outliers can cause issues such as skewing the distribution of the data and leading to poor model performance.There are several techniques that can be used to detect and handle outliers, including IsolationForest, OneClassSVM, EllipticEnvelope, and LocalOutlierFactor. You can also consider removing or interpolating outlier data points as a way to address this issue. By addressing outliers in your data, you can help ensure that your model is better able to generalize to new, unseen data.
