Interviewing has different stages:
1. Preparation for interviews (leetcode, system design, ml design, math, stats and probability problems)
2. Prepare for behavior questions + leadership principles
3. Prep good CV
4. Apply at bunch of companies
5. Arrange interviews
6. Learn company specific stuff
7. Do the interviews
8. Offer Negotiation

Steps 1-2 take most of the time and depends on your current interview prep state.

Steps 3-8 take around 2-3 months

- Process: Screen chat, Python take home (poker hands), Technical Screening (1 math + 1 sde chats), Final rounds(met 4 people)
- Mistakes: Last interview with the CEO (Gavin) could not solve the math question integrate logx... Forgot integration by parts...
- Reject reason: stupid math question + not enough finance background. They asked lots of option pricing stuff. Volatility
trading. Black Scholes is wrong.. Implied volatility
- Their business: portfolio optimization + compression, greek modelling. very niched business. Rates compression, derivatives,
small company. Swaptionizer, swap on options. Capital Lab is under BGC. optimization problem, loss functions, constraint programming
high paced, entrepreneurial environment,regulations → need for optimization, no regulation = no money for CapitaLab

# World Quant
- Position: Quant developer - write internal services and automating tools for quants and portfolio managers
- Time: June 2022
- Reached Stage: Screening

modularity, maintainability, flexible code, no over engineering. Understand whole business, interact with Front Office.

- Time: June 2022
- Reached Stage: Final Round
- Process: Screen chat, Hackerrank (algo + pandas), Technical (algorithms with Michael), Final rounds(met whole team )
They did not make me quant dev offer and wanted to interview me for quant research (said bullish on making an offer)
- Mistakes: On final round they asked what problems would you expect to have when developing a trading strategy and
implementing it in practice. Quant devs take care of that. Data problem, services, notifications the whole pipeline.
I did not know this stuff.
- Reject reason: For QR they asked me about linear regression and how points affect the line. Larger Residuals have larger i
mpact (squared error)... Also the x-axis position of he point matter as well. The farer you are from the mean the larger
impact you have on the regression line.
Question about optimization problems: Linear regression with beta<5 (yes) is that a convex problem. abs(beta) < 5 is that
a convex problem (no - you might be on the wrong side of the parabolla).
Dual problems, how to know you are on global minimum - maximize your dual problem = minimizing your loss

- Questions: Agile, SQL, Python, Linear regression, Optimization problems
- Their business: build renewable energy platform, commodity hedge fund

- Reached Stage: Offer
- Process: Screen chat, Hackerrank (algo + math), Technical Screening (1 algo + 1 ML chats), Final round (went to office,
HR chat + chats with Team + great lunch!)
- Mistakes: In negotiation stage, when they made me an offer I should have asked **right away** if the offer is negotiable.
Always do that, so that you can set expectations for them that you want more. Got in small car/bike accident on the way
to the interview. Don't put your headphones when driving a bike + be concentrated on the driving when doing it.

Presentation talked about ONE project, but could not say whats the final business impact. Overall the 2 Data Science interviews
went 50/50 the rest were excellent. Don't interrupt your interviewer! Felt a bit off after the negotiation process. They made
me good deal and I was hoping to bump a bit more from it, but god bump just 5k. Final offer 120 gbp ~ 160 usd which is good.
However, I felt I could do better and get more money.

+ 1 data chats), Final rounds
- Mistakes: I could not quickly understand the hints during the data interview. It was simple SQL stuff with data table schema.
Algo was leetcode hard and I did it. Communication barrier mistake as I could not get what they meant quickly. Those guys were
data engineers but the feel was like they were traders/pretty sharp, young and quick.

fast-paced environment, flat structure, serve quants mostly

grasp quickly his ideas. Gave me data which was generated from sin((x-const)/const) + N(0,1) and I had to determine that.
Did some visualization stuff, computed correlations, but did not have a structured way to get the final result so I was slow.
I did not enjoy the experience either. Made mistake not to listen Arlo as I should have. Do not interrupt!
