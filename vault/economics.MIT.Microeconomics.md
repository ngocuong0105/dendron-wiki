# MIT 14.01 Principles of Microeconomics

# Lecture 1: Introduction and Supply & Demand

 ## What is microeconomics?

- Microeconomics is a study of how individuals and firms make decisions in a world of **scarcity**.
- Microeconomics = series of constrained optimization exercises
- Microeconomics is a constraied optimization problem
- One of the most important concepts of microeconomics is **OPPORTUNITY COST**
- Every action or inaction has a cost in that you could have done something else instead
- Nothing is free in microeconomics. Everything has a opportunity cost
- Economics is a social science, models are not necessarily 100% correct, but are pretty good.
- Adam Smith is the father of economics
- His book is called the wealth of nations (1776)
- Adam Smith did not use any maths in the book just words but he captured all concepts
- e.g. the 'water and diamond' paradox. Water is way more important than diamonds. It is the building block of our civilization.  First thing you look for in a new planet is water. But water is cheaper than diamond. Why? Supply of water is infinite, diamond is not!
- where supply and demand meet is the market equillibrium
- Positive analysis is the study of things are
- Normative analysis is the study of things should be
- Economics in its core is a right wing science. It is about how the market knows best.
- Adam Smith invisible hand view is that consumers and firms serving their own best interest will do what is best for society. This is the base view of why capilatism works
- 'best for society' defined as most stuff are produced and consumed
- The magic of capitalism. Everybody does the best in their own interest, without caring about anybody else will end up yilding the largest possible productive economy

Why you would not let everything to be decided by the market? I.e. Why allowing people to sell kidney on ebay might be a bad idea?
- Market Failures, fraud, imperfect info
- Inequality (only rich people will have healthy kidney)
- Behavioral Econ, people make mistakes, they might have all the info but still make the wrong decision
