[Chris Deotte interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGCvycOXs2M)

There is alwasy a data property, barrier - breakthrough in the competition which makes the difference in the leaderboard. Find a feature which could change your modelling approach.

To do very very good you need to make a breakthrough. To have a breakthrough the secret is in the EDA. Make lots of plots, check correlation between things and eventually you get an intuation. It is all about the data.

Key components in Kaggle competitions:
- have a fast pipeline where you can run experiments (need to set a good local validation)
- RIGID EDA, to get intuition of the data

See something in the plots and you add a feature, split your model, modify the feature.
