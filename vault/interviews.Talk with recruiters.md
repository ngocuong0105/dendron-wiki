# Current job status

1) I currently work at Capital One as a Senior Analytics Engineer
    • build data tools in Python within the DS team
    • cash flow engine which measures the risk that bank is taking when giving credit to its customers
    • Python and SQL queries
2) Previously I worked as a Data Scientist at TM:
    • startup in the logistic industry
    • build ML models in Python for predicting demand transportation 
    • use forecasts to optimize supply chain = reduce cost of transportation

3) That’s a brief intro of my past experience
Moving forward I am very interested in the Quant developer position you presented to me. I have strong passion for the markets and also given my technical background I like buildings stuff so I believe the Quant developer position you offer is exactly what I am looking for and would love to hear more about it from you.

# Why move
I just joined Capital One 4 months ago and realize that it is soon to move companies, but the reason I want to do it is because I do not feel challenged enough in my current position. Although I had a pretty sharp learning curve in the first few weeks now it has flattened, and I am looking for more challenging opportunities with high paced environment and opportunities to learn more. I believe working at Google I would have this environment and that is why I would like to pursue this opportunity and move companies

# Previous jobs
In these two jobs I work mainly with Python - analyzing large datasets, build data tools for creating machine learning models and automate the process of data generation and analysis.
In total from work and university my programming experience in Python is 3 continuous years . I am familiar with all basic machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, statsmodels, matplotlib, plotly, keras, tensorflow.

# Interested in positions
The positions I am interested in are quantitative developer, quantitative researcher, data scientist, machine learning engineer. The message is that I prefer to be on the back end side. Given my mathematical background, I could focus more on developing the product and solving data modeling problems using math. 

# SALARY EXPECTATIONS
In terms of salary expectations, I am quite flexible and open to discussing what your clients and you believe to be a fair amount for the skill set I can offer and different job openings.

For a benchmark my current salary is X. That being said, I want to emphasize that I am flexible in terms of salary, and if your client is a prestigious company with great working environment I am always open for negotiation regarding the right salary figure for the knowledge and skills that I have.

# Work status
My notice period is 3 months. I do not require a VISA as I have a EU passport. Currently I have presettlement status for the UK so I do not need any sponsorship from your client for getting working rights.

# Return offers
I did not receive a return offer from SIG because the skill set I could offer did not match what SIG was looking for in Quantative Traders. I prefer to be on the back end side and work on modeling the data, rather than being a trader and executing trades on the spot. In SIG some of the trading they did was on the phone with brokers so often you had to make decisions on the spot where gut feeling was quite important and knowing all the maths was not. This was not something that matched my interests  because I prefer to dig in the details of a problem and build models for data.
