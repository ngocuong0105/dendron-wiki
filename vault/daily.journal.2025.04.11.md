# Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling

More machines vs better machines..

# Latency vs Throughput

Latency is measured in milliseconds, throughput is measured in requests per second, or queries per second. 

Low latency is like someone is being able to respond quickly to questions. High Throughput means is like someone who is great at multitasking.

Low latency and acceptable throughput is needed for real-time applications like gaming. 

High throughput and acceptable latency is needed for batch processing. No need for immediate response but you want to get a lot of data from source to destination.


# Gym

Hit it harder! This is what I was thinking during today's gym session. Five out of five, all exercises done. Listening to music during the session makes it feel longer. Without the headphones it is less distracting and all the focus is in hitting the gym. But.. there is always a but... My body becomes so energized that it does not sleep well after the gym session. I might have overtrained, usually 5/5 creates my sleeping problems. On Sunday I'll try to go to the gym early during the day, to see if it's better.
