# Guidelines: Project Selection and Presentation
The project ideas will be judged by internal DS and external stakeholders leaders (judges announced during the offsite). The judges will use the ICE project scoring criteria to rank and select the both the team’s project ideas:
Impact - How impactful is the project on and to what degree? How innovative or scalable is this project (e.g. creates a new insight or capability that can be reused) ? 
Confidence - How confident are we that this project will be well received by stakeholders? How risky is it to invest time and resources into this initiative? What data, prior benchmarks, or intuitions support this confidence?
Ease - How easy will it be to develop and implement this project? Does the team have the skills and capabilities to deliver? What is the level of external dependency or complexity required to execute this project?

In terms of the types of projects, we are leaving it up to you whether it is research, analysis, metrics development, analytics application, workflow automation or some combination therein. However, the project should generally fall within the following guardrails:
- Stakeholder Oriented - The project should ultimately benefit one or more of our business stakeholders (note: This could include automation of a manual DS task or analysis to enable stakeholder self-serve analysis or decisioning). 
- Aligned with goals - The project should be able to map to one or more of the team-wide goals or individual team OKRs we discussed in our Day 1 sessions.
- Effort Constrained - The project should not exceed more than 10-12 data science person-weeks collectively for each team (excluding any other engineering dependencies)

Finally, the final presentation ‘pitch’ to the SharkTank judges for each team should be completed within 15-20 mins maximum; roughly 10 mins for presentation and 5 mins for judges Q & A. The presentation format itself should be done with Google Slides, and should include (but not limited to) the following:
- Problem Definition (The Why) - Focus on outlining ‘Yelp stakeholder X has Y problem’ or  ‘Yelp product area A has B inefficiency or missed value’ AND the size of the opportunity in terms of any product or operational metrics positively impacted over time.
- Solution (The What) - Focus on describing the solution itself and how it gets applied to the problem (e.g. predictive model X to help target user segment Y) AND also the target business impact (e.g. increase engagement metric A by Z%) 
- Approach (The How) - Focus on describing how you will implement and scale the solution, including how you will address dependencies and mitigate any risks (to increase confidence and minimize effort for the overall project)
