        Version control systems
       </a>
       are essential tools of the software engineering world.
More or less every project — serious or hobby, open source or proprietary — uses version control.
Without version control, coordinating a team of programmers all editing the same project’s code will reach pull-out-your-hair levels of aggravation.

If only she could go back in time and retrieve a past version!

       A simple discipline of saving backup files would get the job done.

       Alice uses her judgment to decide when she has reached some milestone that justifies saving the code.
She saves the versions of
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       as
       <code>
        Hello.1.java
       </code>
       ,
       <code>
        Hello.2.java
       </code>
       , and
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       .
She follows the convention that the most recent version is just
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       to avoid confusing Eclipse.
We will call the most recent version the
       <em>
        head
       </em>
       .

       Now when Alice realizes that version 3 is fatally flawed, she can just copy version 2 back into the location for her current code.
Disaster averted!
But what if version 3 included some changes that were good and some that were bad?
Alice can compare the files manually to find the changes, and sort them into good and bad changes.
Then she can copy the good changes into version 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a lot of work, and it’s easy for the human eye to miss changes.
Luckily, there are standard software tools for comparing text; in the UNIX world, one such tool is
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff">
        <code>
         diff
        </code>
       </a>
       .
A better version control system will make diffs easy to generate.

       Alice also wants to be prepared in case her laptop gets run over by a bus, so she saves a backup of her work in the cloud, uploading the contents of her working directory whenever she’s satisfied with its contents.
      </p>
      <p>
       If her laptop is kicked into the Charles, Alice can retrieve the backup and resume work on the pset on a fresh machine, retaining the ability to time-travel back to old versions at will.
      </p>
      <span class="clearfix">
      </span>
      <p>
       Furthermore, she can develop her pset on multiple machines, using the cloud provider as a common interchange point.
Alice makes some changes on her laptop and uploads them to the cloud.
Then she downloads onto her desktop machine at home, does some more work, and uploads the improved code (complete with old file versions) back to the cloud.

       If Alice isn’t careful, though, she can run into trouble with this approach.
Imagine that she starts editing
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       to create “version 5” on her laptop.
Then she gets distracted and forgets about her changes.
Later, she starts working on a new “version 5” on her desktop machine, including
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       improvements.
We’ll call these versions “5L” and “5D,” for “laptop” and “desktop.”
      </p>
      <p>
       When it comes time to upload changes to the cloud, there is an opportunity for a mishap!
Alice might copy all her local files into the cloud, causing it to contain version 5D only.  Later Alice syncs from the cloud to her laptop, potentially overwriting version 5L, losing the worthwhile changes.
What Alice really wants here is a
       <em>
        merge
       </em>
       , to create a new version based on the two version 5’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, considering just the scenario of one programmer working alone, we already have a list of operations that should be supported by a version control scheme:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <em>
         reverting
        </em>
        to a past version
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         comparing
        </em>
        two different versions
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         pushing
        </em>
        full version history to another location
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         pulling
        </em>
        history back from that location
       </li>
       <li>
        <em>
         merging
        </em>
        versions that are offshoots of the same earlier version
       </li>
      </ul>

        Alice and Bob here are like the two Alices working on different computers.
They no longer share a brain, which makes it even more important to follow a strict discipline in pushing to and pulling from the shared cloud server.
The two programmers must coordinate on a scheme for coming up with version numbers.
Ideally, the scheme allows us to assign clear names to
        <em>
         whole sets of files
        </em>
        , not just individual files.
(Files depend on other files, so thinking about them in isolation allows inconsistencies.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Merely uploading new source files is not a very good way to communicate to others the high-level idea of a set of changes.
So let’s add a log that records for each version
        <em>
         who
        </em>
        wrote it,
        <em>
         when
        </em>
        it was finalized, and
        <em>
         what
        </em>
        the changes were, in the form of a short human-authored message.

        Pushing another version now gets a bit more complicated, as we need to merge the logs.
This is easier to do than for Java files, since logs have a simpler structure – but without tool support, Alice and Bob will need to do it manually!
We also want to enforce consistency between the logs and the actual sets of available files: for each log entry, it should be easy to extract the complete set of files that were current at the time the entry was made.
       </p>
       <p>
        But with logs, all sorts of useful operations are enabled.
We can look at the log for just a particular file: a view of the log restricted to those changes that involved modifying some file.
We can also use the log to figure out which change contributed each line of code, or, even better, which person contributed each line, so we know who to complain to when the code doesn’t work.
This sort of operation would be tedious to do manually; the automated operation in version control systems is called
        <em>
         annotate
        </em>
        (or, unfortunately,
        <em>
         blame
        </em>
        ).

        It sometimes makes sense for a subset of the developers to go off and work on a
        <em>
         branch
        </em>
        , a parallel code universe for, say, experimenting with a new feature.
The other developers don’t want to pull in the new feature until it is done, even if several coordinated versions are created in the meantime.
Even a single developer can find it useful to create a branch, for the same reasons that Alice was originally using the cloud server despite working alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        In general, it will be useful to have many shared places for exchanging project state.
There may be multiple branch locations at once, each shared by several programmers.
With the right set-up, any programmer can pull from or push to any location, creating serious flexibility in cooperation patterns.

They support a collaboration graph – who’s sharing what changes with whom – with one master server and copies that only communicate with the master.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a centralized system, everyone must share their work to and from the master repository.
Changes are safely stored
        <em>
         in version control
        </em>
        if they are
        <em>
         in the master repository

       </p>
       <p>
        In a distributed system, all repositories are created equal, and it’s up to users to assign them different roles.
Different users might share their work to and from different repos, and the team must decide what it means for a change to be
        <em>
         in version control
        </em>
        .
If the change is stored in just a single programmer’s repo, do they still need to share it with a designated collaborator or specific server before the rest of the team considers it official?

          In 6.005, we will use Git on the command line.

         The command line is a fact of life, ubiquitous because it is so powerful.

        <p>
         The command line can make it very difficult to see what is going on in your repositories.

        That reading introduces the three pieces of a Git repo:
        <code>
         .git
        </code>
        directory, working directory, and staging area.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of the operations we do with Git — clone, add, commit, push, log, merge, … — are operations on a graph data structure that stores all of the versions of files in our project, and all the log entries describing those changes.
The
        <strong>
         Git object graph
        </strong>
        is stored in the
        <code>
         .git
        </code>
        directory of your local repository.
Another copy of the graph, e.g. for PS0, is on Athena in:
        <br>
         <code>
          /mit/6.005/git/sp16/psets/ps0/[your username].git

       We still haven’t explained what’s in the object graph.
But before we do that, let’s understand step 3 of
       <code>
        git clone
       </code>
       : check out the current version of the

       branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       The object graph is stored on disk in a convenient and efficient structure for performing Git operations, but not in a format we can easily use.
In
       <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/classes/05-version-control/#inventing_version_control">
        Alice’s invented version control scheme
       </a>
       , the current version of
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       was just called
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       because she needed to be able to edit it normally.
In Git, we obtain normal copies of our files by
       <em>
        checking them out
       </em>
       from the object graph.
These are the files we see and edit in Eclipse.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also decided above that it might be useful to support
       <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/classes/05-version-control/#multiple_branches">
        multiple
        <em>
         branches
        </em>
        in the version history
       </a>
       .
Multiple branches are essential for large teams working on long-term projects.
To keep things simple in 6.005, we will not use branches and we don’t recommend that you create any.
Every Git repo comes with a default branch called
       <code>
        master
       </code>
       , and all of our work will be on the
       <code>
        master
       </code>
       branch.
      </p>
      <p>
       So step 2 of
       <code>
        git clone
       </code>
       gets us an object graph, and step 3 gets us a
       <strong>
        working directory
       </strong>
       full of files we can edit, starting from the current version of the project.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s finally dive into that object graph!

       The history of a Git project is a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">
        <strong>
         directed acyclic graph
        </strong>
       </a>
       (DAG).
The history graph is the backbone of the full object graph stored in
       <code>
        .git
       </code>
       , so let’s focus on it for a minute.
      </p>
      <div class="panel panel-figure pull-left">
       <img src="./Reading 5 Version Control_files/hello-git-history.png" width="196">
      </div>
      <p>
       Each node in the history graph is a
       <strong>
        commit
       </strong>
       a.k.a.
       <strong>
        version
       </strong>
       a.k.a.
       <strong>
        revision
       </strong>
       of the project: a complete snapshot of all the files in the project at that point in time.
You may recall from our
       <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/getting-started/#getting_the_history_of_the_repository">
        earlier reading
       </a>
       that each commit is identified by a unique ID, displayed as a hexadecimal number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except for the initial commit, each commit has a pointer to its
       <strong>
        parent
       </strong>
       commit.
For example, commit
       <code>
        1255f4e
       </code>
       has parent
       <code>
        41c4b8f
       </code>
       : this means
       <code>
        41c4b8f
       </code>
       happened first, then
       <code>
        1255f4e
       </code>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Some commits have the same parent: they are versions that diverged from a common previous version.
And some commits have two parents: they are versions that tie divergent histories back together.
      </p>
      <p>
       A branch — remember
       <code>
        master
       </code>
       will be our only branch for now — is just a name that points to a commit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, HEAD points to our current commit — almost.
We also need to remember which branch we’re working on.
So HEAD points to the current branch, which points to the current commit.

        Each commit is a snapshot of our entire project, which Git represents with a
        <strong>
         tree
        </strong>
        node.
For a project of any reasonable size, most of the files
        <em>
         won’t
        </em>
        change in any given revision.
Storing redundant copies of the files would be wasteful, so Git doesn’t do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, the Git object graph stores each version of an individual file
        <em>
         once
        </em>
        , and allows multiple commits to
        <em>
         share
        </em>
        that one copy.
To the left is a more complete rendering of the Git object graph for our example.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keep this picture in the back of your mind, because it’s a wonderful example of the sharing enabled by
        <em>

        , which we’re going to discuss a few classes from now.

       How do we add new commits to the history graph?
       <strong>
        <code>
         git commit
        </code>
       </strong>
       creates a new commit.
      </p>
      <p>
       In some alternate universe,
       <code>
        git commit
       </code>
       might create a new commit based on the current contents of your working directory.
So if you edited
       <code>
        Hello.java
       </code>
       and then did
       <code>
        git commit
       </code>
       , the snapshot would include your changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       We’re not in that universe; in our universe, Git uses that third and final piece of the repository: the
       <strong>
        staging area
       </strong>
       (a.k.a. the
       <strong>
        index
       </strong>
       , which is only a useful name to know because sometimes it shows up in documentation).
      </p>
      <p>
       The staging area is like a proto-commit, a commit-in-progress.
Here’s how we use the staging area and
       <strong>
        <code>
         git add
        </code>
       </strong>
       to build up a new snapshot, which we then cast in stone using
       <strong>
        <code>
         git commit
        </code>

        When you’re working independently, on a single machine, the DAG of your version history will usually look like a sequence: commit 1 is the parent of commit 2 is the parent of commit 3…
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three programmers involved in the history of our example repository.
Two of them – Alyssa and Ben – made changes “at the same time.”
In this case, “at the same time” doesn’t mean precisely contemporaneous.
Instead, it means they made two different
        <em>
         new
        </em>
        versions based on the same
        <em>
         previous

        version, just as

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        When multiple commits share the same parent commit, our history DAG changes from a sequence to a tree: it branches apart.
Notice that a branch in the history of the project doesn’t require anyone to create a new Git branch, merely that we start from the same commit and work in parallel on different copies of the repository:

       , in addition to fetching new parts of the object graph, also updates the working copy by checking out the latest version (just like

       checked out a working copy to start with).

          and

         <li>
          Alyssa creates
          <code>

          and
          <strong>

          her change as
          <code>

          </code>
          .
         </li>
         <li>
          At the same time, Ben creates
          <code>
           hello.rb
          </code>
          and
          <strong>
           commits
          </strong>
          his change as
          <code>

          .
          <br>
           At this point, both of their changes only exist in their local repositories.
In each repo,
           <code>
            master
           </code>
           now points to a different commit.
          <br>
         </li>
         <li>
          Let’s suppose Alyssa is the first to
          <strong>
           push
          </strong>
          her change up to Athena.
         </li>
         <li>
          What happens if Ben tries to push now?
The push will be rejected: if the server updates
          <code>
           master
          </code>
          to point to Ben’s commit, Alyssa’s commit will disappear from the project history!
         </li>
         <li>
          Ben must
          <strong>
           merge
          </strong>
          his changes with Alyssa’s.
          <br>
           To perform the merge, he
           <strong>
            pulls
           </strong>
           her commit from Athena, which does two things:
           <br>
            (a) Downloads new commits into Ben’s repository’s object graph
           <br>
          <br>
         </li>
         <li>
          (b) Merges Ben’s history with Alyssa’s, creating a new commit (
          <code>
           3e62e60
          </code>
          ) that joins together the disparate histories.
This commit is a snapshot like any other: a snapshot of the repository with both of their changes applied.
         </li>
         <li>
          Now Ben can
          <code>
           git push
          </code>
          , because no history will go missing when he does.
         </li>
         <li>
          And Alyssa can
          <code>
           git pull
          </code>
          to obtain Ben’s work.
         </li>
        </ol>

        </div>
       </div>
      </div>
      <p>
       In this example, Git was able to merge Alyssa’s and Ben’s changes automatically, because they each modified different files.
If both of them had edited the
       <em>
        same parts of the same files
       </em>
       , Git would report a
       <strong>
        merge conflict
       </strong>
       .
Ben would have to manually weave their changes together before committing the merge.
All of this is discussed in the

       Git is assuming that most of our project does not change in any given commit, so showing only the differences will be more useful.
Almost all the time, that’s true.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we can ask Git to show us what was in the repo at a particular commit:
      </p>
      <pre class="terminal-dark no-markdown" style="position: relative;"><span class="white ">$</span> git show 3e62e60:
<span class="yellow ">tree 3e62e60:</span>

hello.rb
hello.scm
hello.txt
<div class="open_grepper_editor" title="Edit &amp; Save To Grepper"></div></pre>
      <p>
       Yes, the addition of a
       <code>
        :
       </code>
       completely changes the meaning of that command.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can also see what was in a particular file in that commit:
      </p>
      <pre class="terminal-dark no-markdown" style="position: relative;"><span class="white ">$</span> git show 3e62e60:hello.scm
(display "Hello, version control!")
<div class="open_grepper_editor" title="Edit &amp; Save To Grepper"></div></pre>
      <p>
       This is one of the simplest ways you can use Git to recover from a disaster: ask it to
       <code>
        git show
       </code>
       you the contents of a now-broken file at some earlier version when the file was OK.
      </p>
      <p>
       We’ll practice some disaster recovery commands in class.
