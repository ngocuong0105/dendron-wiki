    "This question is easy to understand and solve conceptually. However, if you do not implement the right way it will be long. Initially during the contest I wrote separate piece of code to check each direction. It worked, but it took some time and it was easy to make mistake. However after the contest, I found this neat implementation going in all directions at once!"
