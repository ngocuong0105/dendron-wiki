    "# Weekly Contest 253\n",
    "This was my eighth leetcode competition and is the first time I managed to solve all 4 problems - 1 easy, 2 mediums, 1 hard in 90 minutes! In terms of difficulty, I believe the questions were not easier than those given in other weeks, but they were more popular and used techniques which were more or less well known for most people. I think this is the reason why overall all competitors performed better.\n",
