USACO is the US highschool olympiad used for selection for IOI. 

I've been doing leetcode for the last 22 months and feel ready to do competitive programming. Thus in Sept 2022, I decided to start with USACO - 25 years old and back to high school...

As of 1st Oct 2022, I am in bronze division.

8th Oct 2022 - just leaned I could get test casses for the problems... Click on the problem name when open USACO's IDE.

14th Oct 2022 - Moved to Silver. Bronze went well overall. Just 3-4 Very Hard questions are remaining (haven't tried yet.) 

23th Oct 2022 - USACO is fucking hard to me. Some teenagers are able to solve these stuff. WTF. Problems are really coold though. Require lots of analysis before writing code.
They are very similar to problems at high school math competitions. Also in order to solve harder problems you really need to believe in yourself and keep pushing.
