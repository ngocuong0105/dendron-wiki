USACO is the US highschool olympiad used for selection for IOI. 

I've been doing leetcode for the last 22 months and feel ready to do competitive programming. Thus in Sept 2022, I decided to start with USACO - 25 years old and back to highschool...

As of 1st Oct 2022, I am in bronze division.

8th Oct - just leaned I could get test casses for the problems... Click on the problem name when open USACO's IDE.

14th Oct - Moved to Silver. Bronze went well overall. Just 3-4 Very Hard questions are remaining (haven't tried yet.)
