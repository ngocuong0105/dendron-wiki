# Machine Learning Roles
Although not a comprehensive list, ML roles can be split into three roles that complement each other in a typical project lifecycle. These roles are:

**Applied Scientists:** Applied Scientists leverage data to identify and tackle opportunity areas, employing statistical inference and machine learning skills in exploratory as well as production settings to develop new products, optimize business metrics, and perform causal inference.

**Machine Learning Engineers:** Machine Learning Engineers work on engineering ML systems such as Yelp’s real-time ad targeting and search ranking services or batch-based content mining applications.  This involves an understanding of software engineering and system design, data ETL and data stores, and machine learning.

**ML Platform Engineers:** ML Platform Engineers build the infrastructure and tooling to support our Machine Learning Engineers and Applied Scientists.

# Your CV

Example LinkdIn profiles of AS/MLE people with no Phd:
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanchaoli/
A lot of projects. His DS work is closely related to productionizing ML pipelines. Also takes part in business definition of the problems using ML.

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianwng/ - Publications...
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/makeshsreedhar/ - no phd but has showed doing some research internships

MLE:
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-lo-19528414a/ (DS/DA)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/aman3014/ (CS, Computer Vision)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/rayan-hatout/ (AI/ML)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/thakarar/ (DS, SE)

- https://www.linkedin.com/in/yunru-l-49157784/(Maths + Engineering)
- https://www.linkedin.com/in/simone-merello-bb0aa6107/ (CS)


Looks like for Meta to become a Research/Applied Scientist you need a phd. Out of 30 profiles I found only 3 without a Phd.

For MLE, looks like you do not need a Phd. Most of the MLE people have Bachelor or MS. However, they all show proof that they know how to code.


**No fluffy things!**

Carefully select which projects to share from your Github (remove snake and ping pong games).

# ML System Design

AS often don't have engineering backgrounds, so we don't expect them to have depth in infrastructure or engineering oriented areas. Eg, MLEs should know about caching and risks of different online vs offline feature code paths; but that's not required for AS.

[Grading System](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UpgErSWshnSN2zBxyb0C5pzB-U-g12Oq/view?usp=share_link)

The focus of the System Design interview is to evaluate whether the candidate can take a somewhat high-level problem, understand the technical requirements and propose a concrete system that solves the problem. While it’s nice if the candidate can solve all parts of the problem, it’s more important for the interviewer to focus on asking good questions and guiding the candidate in order to evaluate the candidate wrt all the criteria that would make them a good “system designer”.

All interviews follow the same format: a short introduction, followed by a significant amount discussion, brainstorming, and when relevant some "white-boarding".

[1-2m] Introduction
Introduce yourself and your team.

How does the work you do impact Yelp?

Mention a few things that make you excited about working at Yelp.

Go over the format of the interview:

Few minutes discussing the candidate’s interests
Bulk of the time on a technical problem involving coding and design
Five minutes at the end for questions about Yelp

[3-5m] Interests
Learn the communication style and build a rapport with the candidate, so that you can better understand them later on. This also helps make them more at ease with the interview format. Note that information from this section isn’t incorporated into your rating, but you can call out any concerns you observe here in your written feedback.

Explain what this interview is about and that it will include little to no coding but will be more of a discussion and possibly some whiteboarding. 

Learn a little of their history from them, past experience, and projects. What types of systems have they worked with?

[35m] System Design
Use one of the 2 questions from the pool of questions in your track that you have familiarized yourself with. This is rare but if it is not the candidate's first SD interview, make sure that the question you chose hasn’t already been used in the previous interview. 

Each system design question has all the details about how to pace the interview, how to nudge and what to focus on. Below are the system design tracks linking to their corresponding SD questions:

[5m] Questions for the interviewer
Allow a few minutes at the end of the interview to allow candidates to ask you questions.
