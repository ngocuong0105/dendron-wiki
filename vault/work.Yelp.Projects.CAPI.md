CAPI is a product which would help Yelp to measure attribution in a more accurate way. User tracking data using third parties such as IOS and Safari is becoming more difficult so we need to create our own API to do that. Our goal is to collect first party data.

**CAPI meeting**
- Kuny, UK London
- DS within Boris's MLOC Market intelligence and attribution team
- I've joined Yelp November last year, so that makes it a total of 7 months.

I am very excited to meet you all and I look forward to working with you on the Conversion API.

Metrics.

FB CAPI is easy to setup almost no coding.
