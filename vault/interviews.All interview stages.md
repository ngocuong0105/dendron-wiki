Interviewing has different stages:
1. Preparation for interviews (**2 months**)
    - algo: neetcode.io + leetcode targeted for companies, cracking the coding interview book
    - system design: [[interviews.System Design]], practice in excalidraw
    - ml design: stefan's escalidraw example is pretty good
    - probability: puzzle's app, 3 quant books
    - stats: [[interviews.Probability and Statistics]]

2. Prepare for behavior questions + leadership principles (**2 weeks**)
    - stories for each of your jobs - stating point is your Job search folder
    - lp principles file from stefan is good
    - cracking the coding interview book
    - why you james reed book
    - [[interviews.Behaviour]]

3. Prepare good CV (**3 days**)
    - one more engineering (for MLE)
    - one more data science (math + stats stuff)
    - this step often will improve through iteration, as you apply to companies and talk stuff you will add/change your CV

4. Apply at bunch of companies (**2 weeks**)
    - timing is key here to get competing offers
    - colllect a list of companies you want to apply for before hand
        - LinkdIn, your previous applications, Referalls (from friends and random Blind users + write a Blind Post), Linkdin recruiters
    - roles to aim for: quant, quant devs, data science, algo engineers, machine learning engineer
    - prepare applications for all of them, don't apply yet! (some may need motivation letters or random stupid questions)
    - prepare messages/talk with recruiters, define what you want in terms of role, company, TC
    - apply at all companies all at once

The next four steps are dynamic and less structured. Your goal is to finish them in the span of **1 to 2 months** (at most).
Main goal is to have competing offers with similar deadlines.

5. Arrange interviews
    - pretty dynamic step, some companies will push for earlier interviews, often with recruiters is like that.

6. Prepare company specific stuff
    - after you get interviews for each company you will need to prepare company specific stuff

7. Do the interviews
    - see [[interviews.Self evaluation]]
    - take notes during each interview to remember company specific stuff

8. Offer Negotiation
    - [[interviews.Negotiation]]
    - look in levels.fyi
    - ask Blind

9. Post offer
    - do self evaluation of the whole interview cycle
    - gather all your notes and put in dendron

Steps 1-2 take most of the time and depends on your current interview prep state.

Steps 3-8 take around 2-3 months

**Total time needed to find new job: 5 months.**
