Did some Hackerrank for 2-3 months before that as I did\nnot know how to code (found it hard to press quickly stuff on the keyboard...). Started leetcoding more seriously mid Feb\n2021 and have been doing it for 1.5 years so far (24 Jul 2022). Current leetcode count is solved <strong>1526</strong> problems. Main progress\nstages were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>first 3 months good learning curve Feb-Apr, but copy-pasted lost of solutions and failed to solve most of the problems alone. Got good progress on easy questions, mediums were very hard for me, hard were impossible.</li>\n<li>May rested a bit and slowed down the leetcoding</li>\n<li>June - August great learning curve, started to solve confidently easy questions, working way through medium alone. Hard\nquestions are still impossible to solve alone, but can understand solutions</li>\n<li>Sep - Dec stayed put and interviewed at companies so was chilling leetcode and tried to keep up the pace</li>\n<li>(2022) Feb - July: great learning curve, confidently solved easy and mediums. Started making progress on hards and for\nsome I am able to do by myself. Had one hard asked during interview and managed to finish in 40 minutes with working solution.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary: for now I am on descent coding level for interviews. For competitive programming, its another story... In leetcode I manged to be in top 2% with 2000+ rating, but in codeforces I would be blown out by those guys.</p>\n<h1 id=\"plans-for-the-future\">Plans for the future<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#plans-for-the-future\"></a></h1>\n<p>Ideally I would become a descent competitive programmer in 1-2 years (written in August 2022). Need to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>do more leetcode competitions</li>\n<li>learn more advanced topics in CLRS</li>\n<li>take the MIT advance courses for algorithms and data structures</li>\n<li>learn C++</li>\n<li>start codeforces</li>\n<li>join Google/Facebook coding jams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Two years later Oct 2024 I haven't become a competitive programmer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I've bruteforced Leetcode and focused on quantity over quantity [MISTAKE]</li>\n<li>Now I'm trying to change that and I really spend time on solving hard problems, thiinking on them and solving them more than one time</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>23.07.2022</strong></p>\n<p>Went to my 21st competition. Solved 3/4 questions. The last one was hard level but it was super easy if you could get the idea. SUPER easy. I kind of gave up when saw that is hard level and there was big mental barrier. I should work on removing this mental barrier from my head. This increases significantly my chances of solving the question.\nI lost 22 points in rating after the competition (2020 points now). Messed up one of the previous questions as well and got time penalties. Overall, I underperformed.</p>\n<p><strong>08.10.2022</strong></p>\n<p>Had 3 bad compatitions and lost a bit of rating. Last competiton went good - solved 4 problems under an hour and got rank around 600. Now rating is 2037. I started doing USACO and am currently in bronze division (easies one). Competitive programming problems seem much harder than leetcode. Some questions in bronze are diffficult,though most of them I am able to solve. But CP is whole another level compared with leetcoding.\nOverall last two months I have been doing standard and a bit more hards unseen problems on leetcode and started competitive programming.

In future I would probably need to learn C++, as Python code is sloooow. Also ordered a Leetcode pack (7800 leetcoins). It is flying from China to here!\nI am more confident in solving hard questions in Leetcode now - say 5.5/10. Easy I am 10/10, medium I am 8.5/10.\nCurrent leetcode count <strong>1743</strong> (08.10.2022)</p>\n<p><strong>30.10.2022</strong></p>\n<p>My best competition performance was yesterday - rank 125 on Biweekly 90.

You started with a small example of two numbers and tried to generalize it. but you made a mistake in the generalizaton. When you played with the example you used the concrete numbers and based on the pattern you tried to generalize. Rather you should have tried to formalize with letters (ti<em>dj &#x3C; tj</em>di) and this would have helped you to come up with a formula for two numbers then this would inspire you to generalize the correct way.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"weekly-contest-413\">Weekly Contest 413<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#weekly-contest-413\"></a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>03/10/2024</li>\n<li>Solved 3 problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What do I learned?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The third problem was a DP</li>\n<li>By looking at the problem constrained I should have thought sooner that I must have e problem subspace that is defined on the cell values</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-score-subarray-queries/description/\">Fourth problem</a>.
