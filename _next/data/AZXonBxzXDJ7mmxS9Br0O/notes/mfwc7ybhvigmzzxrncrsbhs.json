Species that has been extinct for more than 10000 years are brought back to life. These cute little puppies (not puppets) are not only in GoT but in real life, were born somewhere in a lab in the USA. Colossal Biosciences claim to have deciphered the dire wolf genome. They rewrote the genetic code of a common gray wolf to match the dire wolf genome. After careful genetic engineering, Romulus, Remus and baby Khaleesi were born. </p>\n<p>What are dire wolfs? They are bigger, stronger and have larger jaws. Close to monsters. And you don't want to be close to them..</p>\n<h1 id=\"kiss\">KISS<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#kiss\"></a></h1>\n<p>Keep It Simple Stupid!
