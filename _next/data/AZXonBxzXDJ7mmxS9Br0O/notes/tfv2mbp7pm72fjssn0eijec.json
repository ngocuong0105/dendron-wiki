If we apply most traditional (cost-insensitive) classifiers on the dataset, they will likely to predict everything as negative (the majority class). This was often regarded as a problem in learning from highly imbalanced datasets.</p>\n<p>Creating a traditional-cost-insensitive classifier has two assumptions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>goal is to maximize accuracy/minimize loss</li>\n<li>train and test datasets have the same distributions</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Under these assumtions, predicting everything negative is the correct thing to do.</strong></p>\n<p>Thus, the imbalanced class problem becomes meaningful only if one or both of the two assumptions above are not true:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the cost of different types of error is not the same/missclasification cost is not equal</li>\n<li>the train and test data are different</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"when-changing-the-cost-function-works\">When changing the cost-function works<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#when-changing-the-cost-function-works\"></a></h2>\n<p>In the case when the misclassification cost is not equal, it is usually more expensive to misclassify a minority (positive) example into the majority (negative) class, than a majority example into the minority class (otherwise it is more plausible to predict everything as negative). That is, FN > FP. In this case you should have a loss function which penalizes FN more than FP.</p>\n<h2 id=\"when-overundersampling-works\">When over/undersampling works<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#when-overundersampling-works\"></a></h2>\n<p>In case the class distributions of training and test datasets are different (for example, if the training data is highly imbalanced but the test data is more balanced), an obvious approach is to sample the training data such that its class distribution is the same as the test data (by oversampling the minority class and/or undersampling the majority class).</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1763992060664,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"dc095b340c158394d643b84f8585ff0c","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["dgcsvcwea8scgdegrk9tfni","xig93vo47ou1bkr7s4w1wb2","ro9bbyftsutm88mxw6r16p5","ypia1zmywsklpicmcgrzlz1","w7iitlako61ppm27mym400a","6bx5plramu4hksomqc1n55z","4nki3bedlvs3mnkixj3a07k","9r5ym61dkwap92fvbte1jkq","849u97nrsuyekmr4a1r92ux","2b5bwf46z6v132wu7xghvrp","dygp5h2vzw4mkromwmofynb","7h50s7ga5ziiyblmoctsqmw","pglaolxcge4xfvgoph3je89","uy9u1co5ih1fokind8tg0eq","jc23ggp8iiu92kpnzo721to","f1u2a47guuw70olv36bzf66","c1bs7wsjfbhb0zipaywqv1","2av385tcj2cbumxprsauff3","lw1b4r6ykimvj9208nkgzps"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nZdr bebce kp ;)\n\nThis is my knowledge base, additionally I keep [daily journal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m8Npu0-t8RweyKiHCjLL1PPDYzbebqm3OZDHH8IVsb8/edit?tab=t.rj0kvkrm7zpr)."},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":false,"leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart"}},"insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"randomNote":{},"copyNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"title"},"templateHierarchy":"template"},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":"vault"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"task":{"name":"","dateFormat":"","addBehavior":"childOfCurrent","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link","taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"]},"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"dendronVersion":"0.95.0","enableEditorDecorations":true,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"templateHierarchy":"template"},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false},"publishing":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Dendron","description":"Personal knowledge space"},"github":{"enableEditLink":true,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"searchMode":"lookup","assetsPrefix":"/dendron-wiki","siteUrl":"https://ngocuong0105.github.io","duplicateNoteBehavior":{"action":"useVault","payload":["vault"]},"theme":"light","templateVersion":"0.97.0","ga":{"tracking":"G-W5DRRLQ1N7"},"siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
