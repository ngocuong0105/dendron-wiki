Although this takes most of your time in the interviewing cycle it is actually the part you would enjoy the most as it is about solving problems. Make sure you spend proper time on behaviour practice too.</p>\n<p>Steps 3-5 (<strong>warm-up stage + applications</strong>) take about 2-4 weeks. This part is the shortest one. Key here is to adjust your mindset to interview mode. Mocks with friends or paid one help. Also this part includes lots of admin work to make applications. Although it could be tedious it is super important as it gets you the interviews. Make sure you spend enough time on the applications. Need to pull out all your connections for referals, ask Blind for referrals, write to recruiters.</p>\n<p>Steps 6-10 (<strong>interviewing + negotiation</strong>) form the stage where you apply what you have been practicing for. These four steps are dynamic and less structured. Your goal is to finish them in the span of <strong>1 to 2 months</strong> (at most). Main goal is to have competing offers with similar deadlines. Key in this stage is that after doing lots of interviews you might get tired and will be tempted to accept the first descent offer you get. Be willing to put the extra effort to get competing offers as it could pay out pretty well for just a few weeks more of interviewing. Also accepting a job offer means you will be doing that at least a year, and cannot go back quickly to interview mode and increase TC.</p>\n<h1 id=\"principles\">Principles<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#principles\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Interviews are ultimately NOT about you.
