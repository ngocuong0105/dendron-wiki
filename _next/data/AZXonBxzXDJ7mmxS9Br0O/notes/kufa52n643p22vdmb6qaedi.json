Climate policy is the first big area where the “Brussels effect” will be properly tested. On issues such as online privacy, where the EU’s norms have become global ones, countries and companies fall in line because it is not especially expensive to follow suit. Likewise, timber producers in Indonesia have to abide by EU rules otherwise they will not be able to sell into its market. In short, the Brussels effect works when following EU rules is an easy or obvious compromise to make. Expecting other countries to mimic an expensive carbon-trading system is a much bigger ask—particularly when all it guarantees is access to a market that will only shrink as a proportion of the global economy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"get-the-green-right\">Get the green right<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#get-the-green-right\"></a></h2>\n<p>National taxes are more likely to lead to leakage, where polluting activity shifts across borders.</p>\n<h1 id=\"carbon-prices\">Carbon prices<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#carbon-prices\"></a></h1>\n<p>Should we put a price on carbon?</p>\n<p>As of Oct 1, 2023 a quarter of global emissions are now covered, and the share is rising fast.</p>\n<p>Now the price in EU is 80 EUR per tonne of CO2, and it's rising fast.
