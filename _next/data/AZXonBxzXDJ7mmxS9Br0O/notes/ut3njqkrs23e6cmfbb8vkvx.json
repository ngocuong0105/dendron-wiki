The primary function f this system is to connect people who lend with people who want to borrow. Financial institutions are middle men. Their job is the job of <strong>handling money</strong>.</p>\n<p>Why do we need middle men? Often the needs of borrowers cannot be matched by lenders. Borrowers such as governments and companies need large sums of money, lenders usually lend small amounts. Also lenders often want to withdraw their money quickly. Companies need money for longer periods of time. People with mortgages want to borrow for the next 25 years.</p>\n<p>Two variables when lending money:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>time to return/withdraw (related to liquidity)</li>\n<li>amount (related to liquidity)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Borrowers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>businesses - using shares</li>\n<li>governments - using bonds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lenders (need to be net savers)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>private people</li>\n<li>working class</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Middle man:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>banks</li>\n<li>building societies</li>\n<li>pension schemes</li>\n<li>life insurances</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-institutions\">The Institutions<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-institutions\"></a></h2>\n<p>Banks (short term loans):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>commercial (rely on people deposits)</li>\n<li>investment banks (deal with takeovers, trading)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Investment institutions (long period loans)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>pension funds</li>\n<li>life insurance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Trading companies</p>\n<ul>\n<li>hedge funds</li>\n<li>private equity firms (prop trading)</li>\n<li>market makers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Exchanges</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stock exchanges are the most popular (NYC, LSE)</li>\n<li>Commodity exchanges</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"the-instruments\">The Instruments<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#the-instruments\"></a></h2>\n<p><strong>Money is just one of the many financial assets.</strong> What distinguishes all financial assets is their liquidity.</p>\n<p><strong>Greater risk demands greater reward.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Lesser liquidity demands greater reward.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Loans.</strong>Extra returns come from interest rate.</li>\n<li><strong>Bonds</strong>. Loan from government which you can choose to be paid back at expiry or you can trade it before expiry. Bond also pay interest rate called coupons,</li>\n<li><strong>Equities = Shares</strong>.

This system went down in 1970s. Sterling was moved to floating point with the US dollar.</p>\n<p>Floating exchange rates added risks for companies trading worldwide. This was opportunity for financial companies to mitigate foreign-exchange rate.</p>\n<p>There are 3 elements of monetary policy:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>exchange rates</li>\n<li>interest rates</li>\n<li>capital controls</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Under Bretton Woods system, countries controlled their exchange rates and capital flows.</p>\n<p><em>The absence of takeovers meant there was no market discipline on poor companies to perform well.</em></p>\n<p>The free-market model: lower taxes, reduced government deficits and open capital markets.</p>\n<p><strong>Globalization</strong></p>\n<p>What is globalization? It is one of those terms that is often used, but more rarely defined.
