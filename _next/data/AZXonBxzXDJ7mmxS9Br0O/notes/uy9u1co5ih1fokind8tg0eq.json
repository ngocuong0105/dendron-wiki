When money printing exceeds the speed of actual production.</p>\n<p>Small inflation is healthy. Low inflation (deflations) would make people keep their cash. If you could by something\ncheaper in the future then you would wait. Too high inflation leads to products becoming too expensive for people.</p>\n<p>Countries always want small inflation in their currency. Inflation -> more export than import = good. Export = stuff you sell,\nImport = stuff you buy. You want more sell than buy. If you currency is very expensive with no inflation, you will only import.</p>\n<p>Inflation is a way government to take money from its citizens without them realizing it. A way to put money in the people who hold assets. Inflation comes from printing money and whoever gets this money becomes richer (usually government people).</p>\n<p>In inflation everything becomes more expensive. Often people do not save cash, but rather buy mortgage. Money looses its value.</p>\n<p>In period of deflation, or when money has lots of value, then go and invest and buy stuff.</p>\n<h1 id=\"recession\">Recession<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#recession\"></a></h1>\n<p>Economic downturn.

Measured in CPI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Often low or too high inflation leads to recession.</p>\n<p>The year is 2022. 2 years after COVID. We enter recession??? Weird how during covid we thought it was a crisis and we\nwere in recession. However the true recession comes now, with super high inflation (15% in UK/EU), and it comes after all\ngovernments printed a bunch of money to \"help\" people. Macro economics is super weird and I am not sure how to build\nintuition for that.</p>\n<h1 id=\"events\">Events<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#events\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Jan 2022, Meta stock price crashes 50%.</li>\n<li>US printed 2 trillion + dollars the most of all governments and the USD became more expensive.

This is a smooth way to steal from you.\nIndeed, the act of printing money benefits only those who would get large portions of the money. You are unlikely to be part\nof this portion, like most people. Therefore, printing money just makes the money you have less valuable and you should\nlook for other places to store value.</p>\n<h1 id=\"socialism-vs-capitalism\">Socialism vs Capitalism<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#socialism-vs-capitalism\"></a></h1>\n<p>Market demand should drive what type of market is better. Healthcare should be social, government should participate in that\nmarket because demand for health is distributed uniformly. Probability of rich and poor people get cancer is relatively\nthe same. For sports cars market should be capitalism. P(rich person buys lambo) >> P(poor person buys lambo).</p>\n<p>Markets where there should be government intervention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>healthcare</li>\n<li>education?</li>\n<li>war weapons</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"what-should-governments-do\">What should governments do?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#what-should-governments-do\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>protect borders</li>\n<li>enforce laws equally</li>\n<li>create laws</li>\n<li>make business environment better</li>\n<li>take care of poorest people? Maybe with small amount of taxes.</li>\n<li>justice system</li>\n<li>infrastructure? Not sure about this one. Building towns and roads can be done by private sector I think.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Should the government play any social part in people's life? The more responsibilities a government has, the less freedom\nindividual people have. Therefore I think government should not do social politics at all. Social politics is a fancy term\nfor taking money from the ones who have money to the ones who do not have money. That is the core of social politics. It\ntakes money from those who work and gives it to those who don't.</p>\n<h1 id=\"when-a-company-should-go-public\">When a company should go public?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#when-a-company-should-go-public\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"euro-funds-and-government-subsidiaries\">Euro funds and government subsidiaries<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#euro-funds-and-government-subsidiaries\"></a></h1>\n<p>Governments should not support businesses. During crisis, during economic upturn, whatever. Businesses should exist and make\nmoney only because their clients say so and buy their products  Euro fund, 'obshtestveni prouchki' is just a way for\nthe government to give money to their friends and family.</p>\n<h1 id=\"investing\">Investing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#investing\"></a></h1>\n<p>In your end lifetime, when you compute total networth accumulated through all years, it is likely most of the money you make\nwould be from investments rather than from your work. Always have this in mind.</p>\n<p>Look for opportunities when people are afraid to invest, do not invest when everybody is doing that. Now the stock markets\nhave crashed by quite a bit (July 2022), I think I should put some money on this.</p>\n<p>Housing market is crazy, peak after peak. It feels it slows down a bit and we might reach a downturn. For my personal\nfinances I would have enough money to get in the market after 2-3 years. Let's see if there is a downturn...</p>\n<h1 id=\"european-green-deal\">European green deal<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#european-green-deal\"></a></h1>\n<p>More bureucracy?</p>\n<h1 id=\"thoughts-on-diversity-and-inclusion\">Thoughts on diversity and inclusion<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#thoughts-on-diversity-and-inclusion\"></a></h1>\n<p>People from the PRIDE are super innocent. I support most of their positions. Rights to get married and in general they just\nwant to be accepted by the community. If they get these thing our society would only be net happier. This does not make other\npeople unhappy. Adoption is another topic though. The life of the adopted kids could get worse. Straight couples should have\npriority when adopting in societies where gay people are still not accepted.</p>\n<h1 id=\"should-we-support-in-country-made-stuff\">Should we support in-country made stuff?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#should-we-support-in-country-made-stuff\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"reform-the-justice-system-thoughts\">Reform the justice system thoughts<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#reform-the-justice-system-thoughts\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>from state to private prosecutors will lead to less corrupted prosecutors</li>\n<li>judges have to be chosen by the state?

It does not need to be optimized and managed well because it cannot go bankrupt. The fear of failing and going bankrupt is what drives businesses and organizations to move forward. Death is inevitable in every meaningful life. We need to let the broken pension system to either die and build a new one or let it recover. But we need to put in on the free market with voluntary taxes. Then it will receive money only if it can assure the society that it will pay good pensions/provide good service for these taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"bbr-bg-bank-za-razvitie\">BBR (bg bank za razvitie)<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#bbr-bg-bank-za-razvitie\"></a></h1>\n<p>Should that be privatized?</p>\n<h1 id=\"pp-vs-db\">PP vs DB<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#pp-vs-db\"></a></h1>\n<p>PP are a bit left populists (e.g 'Use right instruments' for left ideas). However, they have strong leadership. DB match\nmy political views the best among all parties but have weak leadership. Hristo Ivanov is a good politician but his best role\nin a party is to be an advisor rather than leader. He is a bit 'filosof'. I am happy he recently proposed wide coalition\nbetween them and PP and all the right centrist 'city' parties/community.</p>\n<p>PP have shown several times that are good negotiators and able to group different peoples in one place. Is that true though?\nIn the coalition of 4 parties BSP, PP, ITN, DB, BSP has been able to push for many of their leftist ideas. PP put a cap\nprice on electricity in Jan 2022. THat's super weird move and I doubt they teach this stuff in Harvard Business School.</p>\n<p>DB has been quite consistent with their promises to the people (except being in coalition with BSP). They have pushed for\njustice reform, e-government, low taxes and fighting against corruption. I am pleased with what they've done. I hope\nPP would agree to have pre-election coalition with them.</p>\n<h1 id=\"are-bsp-less-corrupted-as-of-2022\">Are BSP less corrupted as of 2022?<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#are-bsp-less-corrupted-as-of-2022\"></a></h1>\n<p>It is very controversial to see PP, ITN and DB to agree to be in coalition with BSP. All these 3 parties have talked against\nBSP to some extend or another. Does that mean BSP are less corrupted now or political parties just need their votes and\nbecome corrupted as well? I think it is pretty hard to determine if a party is corrupted anyways. PP, ITN and DB do not\nmost probably do not know if BSP is corrupted. They are for sure much less corrupted than 15 years ago when they were in\npower. What, I admire about BSP is that they have very consistent political views and have clearly identified them in the\npolitical and economical spectrum. I do not agree with their views but respect that they stay consistent. I am definitely not\nhappy that they have seats in the government but what can we do?</p>\n<h1 id=\"government-2nd-aug-2022\">Government 2nd Aug 2022.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#government-2nd-aug-2022\"></a></h1>\n<p>New government by president Radev (3rd in the last year and a half). Tis one is a bit communist, pro-Russia and do not\nhave all stars like Kiril and Asen. Seems not competent too. Radev made some really good moves with bringing Asen and Kiril\nand riding the protests wave in summer 2021. Now he seems to have deviated from this direction and is more pro-Russia.\nLike ITN it looks like everybody is fighting for themselves.</p>\n<h1 id=\"rank-choice-voting-system\">Rank Choice Voting System<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#rank-choice-voting-system\"></a></h1>\n<p>This voting system is used when we need a clear winner (president or mayor elections).\nFirst Past the Post is not a a fair system. Even with balotage system, the 2nd round is not fair (although probably better than FPTP), e.g. elections for mayor in Sofia with Fandukova, Manolova, Boris Bonev and Da Bulgaria. The balotage had Fandukova vs Manolova, but with ranked choice we could have Bonev(or Da Bulgaria) vs Fandukova.</p>\n<p>Each person votes by ranking the parties 1,2,3 etc.</p>\n<p>If there is a mojaorty winner they win. If not the lowest candidate is removed and the votes of the people who voted for him are distributed to the other candidates (whoever was their second choice gets all the votes). This is repeated until there is a majority winner.</p>\n<h1 id=\"questionier-before-voting\">Questionier before voting<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#questionier-before-voting\"></a></h1>\n<p>Every time you vote you need to fill in the answers of 3 questions that parties have answered.
