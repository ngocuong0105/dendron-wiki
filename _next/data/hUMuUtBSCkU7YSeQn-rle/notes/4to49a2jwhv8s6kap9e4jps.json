Smaller city hase huge effect on the SMAPE.\n\nNow suppose you use rate of change as Target\nSMAPE = SMAPE(city A) + SMAPE(city B) = 1/1 + 0.05/0.15 = 1 + 1/3\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>The example above shows that small cities can have huge impact on SMAPE and last value model should generrally be used for them</strong></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1744237493819,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ea936af1aea818f3052610daac103a63","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["dgcsvcwea8scgdegrk9tfni","xig93vo47ou1bkr7s4w1wb2","ro9bbyftsutm88mxw6r16p5","ypia1zmywsklpicmcgrzlz1","w7iitlako61ppm27mym400a","6bx5plramu4hksomqc1n55z","4nki3bedlvs3mnkixj3a07k","9r5ym61dkwap92fvbte1jkq","849u97nrsuyekmr4a1r92ux","2b5bwf46z6v132wu7xghvrp","dygp5h2vzw4mkromwmofynb","7h50s7ga5ziiyblmoctsqmw","pglaolxcge4xfvgoph3je89","uy9u1co5ih1fokind8tg0eq","jc23ggp8iiu92kpnzo721to","f1u2a47guuw70olv36bzf66","c1bs7wsjfbhb0zipaywqv1","2av385tcj2cbumxprsauff3","v77wdzobzcackzimz6a7crv"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Knowledge Base!
