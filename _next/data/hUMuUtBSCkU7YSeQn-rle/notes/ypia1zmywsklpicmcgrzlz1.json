They advocate for social safety nets, public education, and healthcare.</li>\n<li>Social Policies: Liberals often support progressive social policies, such as LGBTQ+ rights, environmental protection, and gender equality.</li>\n<li>Role of State: Liberals believe in a balanced role for the state, where it ensures individual rights, promotes equality, and provides necessary public services.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"neoliberalism\">Neoliberalism<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#neoliberalism\"></a></h1>\n<p><em>neo = new</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Historical Context: Neoliberalism specifically refers to a revival of classical liberal economic thought in the mid-20th century, advocating for a free-market economy with minimal government intervention.</li>\n<li>Economic Approach: Neoliberals emphasize free-market capitalism, deregulation, reduced government spending, and privatization of public services. They believe that market forces should dictate most aspects of the economy.</li>\n<li>Social Policies: Neoliberalism focuses primarily on economic policies and does not inherently prescribe specific social policies. It prioritizes economic efficiency over social equality.</li>\n<li>Role of State: Neoliberals advocate for a limited role of the state in the economy. They believe that market mechanisms, if left unimpeded, will lead to optimal economic outcomes.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"liberalism-1\">Liberalism:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#liberalism-1\"></a></h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Role of Government:</strong> Liberals believe in a significant role for the government in addressing social and economic inequalities. They support government intervention to promote social welfare, education, healthcare, and workers' rights.</li>\n<li><strong>Individual Rights:</strong> Liberals emphasize individual rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech, religion, and assembly. They also advocate for civil liberties and equal protection under the law for all citizens.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Liberals often advocate for policies aimed at reducing social inequalities. They support progressive taxation, social safety nets, and affirmative action programs to address historical injustices.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Approach:</strong> While liberals support market economies, they believe in regulation to prevent market failures and ensure fair competition. They advocate for a balance between free-market principles and social welfare policies.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"libertarianism\">Libertarianism:<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#libertarianism\"></a></h1>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Role of Government:</strong> Libertarians advocate for minimal government intervention in both the economy and personal lives. They believe in limited government functions, primarily focused on protecting individual rights and maintaining law and order.</li>\n<li><strong>Individual Rights:</strong> Libertarians prioritize individual liberty and personal freedom. They emphasize the right to own property, make personal choices, and engage in voluntary transactions without government interference.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Justice:</strong> Libertarians argue that voluntary exchanges and free markets can address social issues more efficiently than government intervention. They oppose wealth redistribution programs and affirmative action, relying on individual merit and voluntary charity.</li>\n<li><strong>Economic Approach:</strong> Libertarians advocate for free-market capitalism with minimal regulations. They believe that market forces and individual choices should determine economic outcomes, leading to innovation, efficiency, and prosperity.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In summary, while both liberalism and libertarianism emphasize individual rights, liberalism supports a more active role for government in addressing social inequalities and ensuring social justice, whereas libertarianism advocates for minimal government intervention, relying on voluntary interactions and free markets to solve societal issues.</p>\n<h1 id=\"conservatism\">Conservatism<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#conservatism\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"socialism\">Socialism<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#socialism\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"marxism\">Marxism<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#marxism\"></a></h1>\n<p><a class=\"color-tag\" style=\"--tag-color: #fbdd7e;\" href=\"/dendron-wiki/notes/q334c9dkrbs70eq5gujgcb3\">#TODO</a></p>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1744237493819,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ea936af1aea818f3052610daac103a63","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["dgcsvcwea8scgdegrk9tfni","xig93vo47ou1bkr7s4w1wb2","ro9bbyftsutm88mxw6r16p5","ypia1zmywsklpicmcgrzlz1","w7iitlako61ppm27mym400a","6bx5plramu4hksomqc1n55z","4nki3bedlvs3mnkixj3a07k","9r5ym61dkwap92fvbte1jkq","849u97nrsuyekmr4a1r92ux","2b5bwf46z6v132wu7xghvrp","dygp5h2vzw4mkromwmofynb","7h50s7ga5ziiyblmoctsqmw","pglaolxcge4xfvgoph3je89","uy9u1co5ih1fokind8tg0eq","jc23ggp8iiu92kpnzo721to","f1u2a47guuw70olv36bzf66","c1bs7wsjfbhb0zipaywqv1","2av385tcj2cbumxprsauff3","v77wdzobzcackzimz6a7crv"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Knowledge Base!
