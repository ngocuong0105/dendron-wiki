Water is way more important than diamonds. It is the building block of our civilization.  First thing you look for in a new planet is water. But water is cheaper than diamond. Why?

It is about how the market knows best.</li>\n<li>Adam Smith invisible hand view is that consumers and firms serving their own best interest will do what is best for society. This is the base view of why capilatism works</li>\n<li>'best for society' defined as most stuff are produced and consumed</li>\n<li>The magic of capitalism.

McDonald – Small is $1.22 but for 50 more cents you can double the size. Why do they give twice as much for much less than twice as much money? Its all about diminishing MU, you’re desperate for the first soda on a hot day, but not twice as much for the next glass. Those prices reflect market’s reaction to diminishing MU. If you think about demand and supply, the demand for 1st 16 ounces is higher than the demand for the 2nd 16 ounces, but the cost to produce the drink is the same. Since the demand for the next 16 ounces doesn’t shift twice as much, you can only charge 50 cents for the next 16 ounces. Price increments get smaller because of diminishing MU.</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, say you buy breakfast cereal in bulk from costco. Then every day the cereal will be my first cereal and will have high utility to me. There is some diminishin but it is much less. Buing in bulk is much cheaper than buying every day a cereal so why does the market does not factor out the small diminishing return of eating a cereal?</p>\n<p>This is related to packaging costs, but also buing in bulk from costco for many things is not much cheaper than buying seperately from supermarkets.\nBuing in bulk is cheaper but it is not as nearly as chaper as the staqrbucks and mcdonalds example. When utility diminishess less then they do not want to charge much less for multiple packages. Here we have the factor of parishable and non-parishable goods. When it is parishable then it has diminishing return when it is non-parishable you can 'reset' the utility.</p>\n<h1 id=\"lecture-3-budget-constraints-and-constrained-choice\">Lecture 3.
