Six month in college he had no idea what he was doing and did not see value in it. He decided to attend classes which he was interested in! He stayed in college, just did not study what he had to. Studied calligraphy and was super interested in it. At the time of the study he had no idea how it would help him. 10 years later it came back when designing Mac. Cannot connect the dots looking forward but it all comes back! You need to believe that the dots will connect!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Love and loss - Keep looking, don't settle</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He was fired when he was 30 from his own company. He decided to start over. \"Being fired from Apple was one of the best things happened to me.\" Started his most creative years - founded Next, Pixel, found his wife.

Don't settle!\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Death - thinking about death makes you think 'I have noting to loose, follow your heart'</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\"If you live each day as if it's your last, someday you will be right.\" Look in the mirror and ask yourself \"If today is my last day would I do this today.\" Many 'no-s' in a row means you need to change something.\nDeath is the destination we all share.

When I started I thought too much of myself and that I could do whatever I want. Didn't realize that the true work actually started then... I thought I did so much work at highschool and that success was 'v kurpa vurzano'. Kind of wasted first year completely and half of second year. Had some 'love' distractions which affected my study focus and was pretty bad. Basically these 'love' distractions distracted me for nearly 4 years... Super stupid from my side but well, that's it. Now in 2022 I am fully back. I think I got over the love distractions in 100% around March 2020 (covid started and was last year of uni). At that point in time I have 0 in-person and remote contact with the distraction. Felt good. Felt great.</p>\n<p>The fact that when talking about my Oxford experience I firstly start rambling about 'love' distractions proves I wasted a fair amount of time there. It is a pity to waste Oxford years like that but whatever.</p>\n<p>Main mistake I made during these 4 years is that I did not ave a clear and consistent study plan. I was mainly studying in Hilary and Trinity, skipped lots of classes and lectures and did not have a way to measure my progress. I did not track time/work done in almost any way. And then I got average grades and just complained..</p>\n<p>Another mistake is I had some bad influence from toxic people. Should avoid this toxicity as much as possible!</p>\n<p>Had a lot of procrastination too</p>\n<p>Main mistake is I did not have a plan. Cultural plan, Studying plan, How to live independently plan, healthy lifestyle plan.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SIG internship</p>\n<p>Malko me pobivat trupki kato se setq za tozi experience</p>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"fitness-and-health\">Fitness and health<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#fitness-and-health\"></a></h1>\n<p>It is not expensive (time-wise and money-wise) to become nacepen.

Its optimizing for people's inertia.</p>\n<p>This is why this community exists as it allows us in the industry the tools to collaborate to ensure we make the best TC we can.</p>\n<p>This trend of needing to job hop extends far beyond tech and really is the economy as a whole.

TC is okish at 160K annually and that is good.  But my problem is that the last 2 years there have been little progress both in terms of TC but also in terms of skills/learnings. I found a girl that I like but it is an LDR - kind of sucks. All is good with her and I feel good about it. There are some yellow/red-ish flags but only time will show if my concerns are unnecessary. I think I will give it a chance.</p>\n<p>Career-wise, my problem solving abilties are more or less the same as 2 years ago. OMG time flies so fast. I learned a bit of Kaggle, just slightly.
