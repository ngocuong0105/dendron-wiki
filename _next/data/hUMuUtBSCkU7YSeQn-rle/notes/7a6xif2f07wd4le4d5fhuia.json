Moreover, for\nsome problems we can exploit the regular pattern of table accesses in the dynamic-\nprogramming algorithm to reduce time or space requirements even further. Alter-\nnatively, if some subproblems in the subproblem space need not be solved at all,\nthe memoized solution has the advantage of solving only those subproblems that\nare deÔ¨Ånitely required.</li>\n<li>Greedy. How can we tell whether a greedy algorithm will solve a particular\noptimization problem?
