The next day, a coalition of Arab states, allied with Palestinian factions, attack Israeli forces in what becomes the first of several Arab-Israeli wars. In the end, Israel gains control of an even larger portion of territory — not including the areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. An estimated 700,000 Palestinians flee or are driven from their land in what Palestinians refer to as the “Nakba,” or “catastrophe” in Arabic.</p>\n<h1 id=\"july-1956-the-suez-crisis\">July 1956: The Suez Crisis<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#july-1956-the-suez-crisis\"></a></h1>\n<p>Suez canal WAS on the border between Israel and Egypt.

Israel takes control of the Gaza Strip, Sinai, the West Bank, the Golan Heights and predominantly Palestinian East Jerusalem. The Arab armies suffer massive losses.</p>\n<h1 id=\"october-1973-the-yom-kippur-war\">October 1973: The Yom Kippur War<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#october-1973-the-yom-kippur-war\"></a></h1>\n<p>A coalition of Arab nations, led by Egypt and Syria attacks Israel on Yom Kippur, a Jewish holy day when nobody works.</p>\n<h1 id=\"september-1978-egypt-israel-deal\">September 1978: Egypt Israel deal<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#september-1978-egypt-israel-deal\"></a></h1>\n<p>It lays the foundation to a peace deal between the two countries the next year, including Israel’s eventual withdrawal from the Sinai Peninsula. It also sets out a framework for a process of Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza. </p>\n<p>Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) is recognized by Israel and the United States as a negotiating partner.</p>\n<h1 id=\"1993-oslo-accords\">1993: Oslo accords.<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#1993-oslo-accords\"></a></h1>\n<p>PLO and Israel chart the expansion of a limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza. Left unresolved, however, are key issues such as Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem, which is viewed by the Palestinians as the capital of any future state.</p>\n<h1 id=\"2006-hamas-elected-in-gaza\">2006: Hamas elected in Gaza<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2006-hamas-elected-in-gaza\"></a></h1>\n<p>Israel withdraws its troops from Gaza in 2005.

He cobbles together the most far-right government in Israeli history, which critics say has begun to crush any prospect of a two-state solution.</p>\n<h1 id=\"october-2023-israel-says-its-at-war-after-hamas-attack\">October 2023: Israel says it’s ‘at war’ after Hamas attack<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#october-2023-israel-says-its-at-war-after-hamas-attack\"></a></h1>\n<p>Netanyahu formally declares war on Hamas on Oct. 8 following a surprise assault by Hamas militants that came a day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the 1973 Yom Kippur War.</p>\n<p>The U.S., E.U. and Britain condemned the attacks while pledging support to Israel.
