leaderboard. Find a feature which could change your modelling approach.</p>\n<p>To do very very good you need to make a breakthrough. To have a breakthrough the secret is in the EDA. Make lots of plots, check correlation between things and eventually you get an intuition. It is all about the data.</p>\n<p>Key components in Kaggle competitions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>have a fast pipeline where you can run experiments (need to set a good local validation)</li>\n<li>RIGID EDA, to get intuition of the data</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See something in the plots and you add a feature, split your model, modify the feature.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdyuCqmLMUg&#x26;t=944\">Beyond Feature Selection</a></p>\n<p><strong>Is more features better? should I just get more and more features?</strong></p>\n<p>More features is generally better. As long as your features bring novel information it is good.</p>\n<p>Decision trees have built in Feature Selection. for each split you choose the best split - it is a feature selection algorithm.</p>\n<p><strong>So do we really need FS when training Decision Trees (LGBM, XGBOOST)</strong>. The answer is yes. You still need. It does happen your model on the sample data might pick up noisy feature. So you still need FS.</p>\n<p>Feature selection can reduce the number of features and you can get your AUC/Score up by a few points.</p>\n<p><code>scikit-learn</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Univariate analysis: \n<ul>\n<li>variance threshold</li>\n<li>F-test (ANOVA)</li>\n<li>Forward selection in simple Ridge regression</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>RFE (recursive feature elimination) a Kaggler says it works well</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There is some bias in the feature selection.

If you transfor the target with log, you get a metric which is almost like MAE.</p>\n<p>Understand the problem that is being solved. Understand the metric. Understand the data.</p>\n<p>How good a feature is depends on the competition metric!!! Feature importance, correlations, etc. are not that important.</p>\n<p>Setup good Cross validation local setup. You CV score should correlate with the public LB.</p>\n<p><strong>Track the Train-Test error GAP</strong> Large gap indicates overfit. When your CV score is increasing and the gap is not incrasing a lot, then you are not overfitting.</p>\n<p>For xgboost/LGBM no need to worry about one hot encoding, or nan values.

Feature X and Feature Y might be good only if you use both (as they have interation).</p>\n<p>If your model has many features (e.g xgboost) try using small colsample. Usually you would use 80-90%. But when having MANY features, this way your trees would be almost independent and not correlated.</p>\n<p>Working with NN or linear models, when a feature you have NAN, add additional boolean column.</p>\n<p>NN are making feature engineering implicitly.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtqtM1UJfZc&#x26;t\">Giba talk, tips for feature engineering and selection</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8oBphPOliM\">Kaggle Grandmaster and startup</a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>CPU/RAM management is 1st priority</li>\n<li>Work on a single model as long as you can (1 week for other models)</li>\n<li>ML is just function approximation of the real world</li>\n<li>Tree methods ARE sensitive to noisy/useless features (spend enough time in Feature selection...)</li>\n<li>In kaggle you do not always have CV LB correlation (you have absolute noise in the LB, or the dataset is very small)</li>\n<li>Every time the dataset is small - you can do 5 Fold CV, repeated with 20 different CV splits.

If we have a problem, we can look at the feature that was most out of place. The problem may be that there were values that were only seen in, say, training data, but not in the test data. If the contribution to the ROC is very high from one feature, it may well be a good idea to remove that feature from the model.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/code/carlmcbrideellis/what-is-adversarial-validation\">kaggle post</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"check-for-covariate-shift-in-train-and-test\">Check for covariate shift in train and test<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#check-for-covariate-shift-in-train-and-test\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>adversarial validation</li>\n<li>KS test for the features to see if they are from the same distribution</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"check-for-target-shift-in-train-and-test\">Check for target shift in train and test<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#check-for-target-shift-in-train-and-test\"></a></h1>\n<p>Good to understand th dynamics of the target variable.

This evaluates whether a feature by itself is consistent over time. 95% were but we found 5% of columns hurt our models. They had training AUC around 0.60 and validation AUC 0.40. In other words some features found patterns in the present that did not exist in the future. Of course the possible of interactions complicates things but we double checked every test with other tests.</p>\n<p>Whatever feature selection you do <strong>you should separete feature selection from model training.</strong> This avoid data leakage.

Impurity is quantified by the splitting criterion of the decision trees (Gini, Log Loss or Mean Squared Error). However, this method can give high importance to features that may not be predictive on unseen data when the model is overfitting Permutation-based feature importance, on the other hand, avoids this issue, since it can be computed on unseen data.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, impurity-based feature importance for trees are strongly biased and favor high cardinality features (typically numerical features) over low cardinality features such as binary features or categorical variables with a small number of possible categories.</p>\n<p>This problem stems from two limitations of impurity-based feature importances:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>impurity-based importances are biased towards high cardinality features;</li>\n<li>impurity-based importances are computed on training set statistics and therefore do not reflect the ability of feature to be useful to make predictions that generalize to the test set (when the model has enough capacity).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"permutation-importance\">Permutation importance<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#permutation-importance\"></a></h2>\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code class=\"language-python\"><span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> sklearn<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>inspection <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> permutation_importance\n</code></pre>\n<p>Permutation importance does not reflect to the intrinsic predictive value of a feature by itself but how important this feature is <strong>for a particular model.</strong></p>\n<p>We measure the importance of a feature by calculating the increase in the model’s prediction error after permuting the feature. A feature is “important” if shuffling its values increases the model <strong>error</strong>, because in this case the model relied on the feature for the prediction. A feature is “unimportant” if shuffling its values leaves the model error unchanged, because in this case the model ignored the feature for the prediction. </p>\n<p>To highlight which features contribute the most to the generalization power of the inspected model permutation importance should be computed on validation set.</p>\n<p>Sklearn permutation_importance takes as input a fitted model. Thus based on the selected features/weights during training it computes the importance of the features. These features importance show how good are these features for this particular model. </p>\n<p><strong>Another take on feature importance is: to do permutation importance before model training.</strong> This should be done manually (I don't know about a library)\nAdvatange is that is more acurate, disadvantage is that you loose a lot of time in training.</p>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>\nWhen two features are correlated and one of the features is permuted, the model will still have access to the feature through its correlated feature. This will result in a lower importance value for both features, where they might actually be important.</p>\n<p>One way to handle this is to cluster features that are correlated and only keep one feature from each cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"model-class-reliance\">Model Class Reliance<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#model-class-reliance\"></a></h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01489.pdf\">Paper</a></p>\n<h1 id=\"dynamic-label-smoothing\">Dynamic label smoothing<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#dynamic-label-smoothing\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"throw-complex-models-on-high-weight-data\">Throw complex models on high weight data<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#throw-complex-models-on-high-weight-data\"></a></h1>\n<h1 id=\"2-submisssions--bet-both-on-heads-and-tails\">2 submisssions = bet both on heads and tails<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#2-submisssions--bet-both-on-heads-and-tails\"></a></h1>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/224079\">tricks on Jane Street comp</a></p>\n<hr>\n<strong>Backlinks</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/dendron-wiki/notes/2b5bwf46z6v132wu7xghvrp\">Machine Learning</a></li>\n</ul>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1744237493819,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ea936af1aea818f3052610daac103a63","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["dgcsvcwea8scgdegrk9tfni","xig93vo47ou1bkr7s4w1wb2","ro9bbyftsutm88mxw6r16p5","ypia1zmywsklpicmcgrzlz1","w7iitlako61ppm27mym400a","6bx5plramu4hksomqc1n55z","4nki3bedlvs3mnkixj3a07k","9r5ym61dkwap92fvbte1jkq","849u97nrsuyekmr4a1r92ux","2b5bwf46z6v132wu7xghvrp","dygp5h2vzw4mkromwmofynb","7h50s7ga5ziiyblmoctsqmw","pglaolxcge4xfvgoph3je89","uy9u1co5ih1fokind8tg0eq","jc23ggp8iiu92kpnzo721to","f1u2a47guuw70olv36bzf66","c1bs7wsjfbhb0zipaywqv1","2av385tcj2cbumxprsauff3","v77wdzobzcackzimz6a7crv"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Knowledge Base!
