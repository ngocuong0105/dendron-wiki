It’s honestly mind-blowing. I felt this rush of excitement the entire time — like something clicked. I think this is it. This is what I want to do. ML, DL, AI… this whole world feels like home to me.</p>\n<p>It’s crazy to think about how far we’ve come. Back in university, all those concepts felt so abstract — just math and theory. But now? I can literally talk to AI agents. I can generate images with a few lines of code. My computer can speak, understand, and even create. It’s like living in a sci-fi movie, except it’s real.</p>\n<p>I feel so inspired. The future feels wide open, and I want to be part of building it. There’s something magical about this field — the pace, the creativity, the impact. I’m dreaming big tonight. I want to learn more, build things, and maybe even teach one day. Who knows?</p>\n<p>LLMs does not have the classical DL problem of overfitting.
