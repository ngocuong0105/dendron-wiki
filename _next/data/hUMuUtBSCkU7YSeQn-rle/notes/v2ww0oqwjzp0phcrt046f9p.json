Quant devs take care of that. Data problem, services, notifications the whole pipeline.\nI did not know this stuff.</li>\n<li>Reject reason: For QR they asked me about linear regression and how points affect the line. Larger Residuals have larger impact (squared error)... Also the x-axis position of he point matter as well. The farer you are from the mean the larger impact you have on the regression line.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Question about optimization problems: Linear regression with beta&#x3C;5 (yes) is that a convex problem. abs(beta) &#x3C; 5 is that a convex problem (no - you might be on the wrong side of the parabola).</p>\n<p>Dual problems, how to know you are on global minimum - maximize your dual problem = minimizing your loss</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions: Agile, SQL, Python, Linear regression, Optimization problems</li>\n<li>Their business: build renewable energy platform, commodity hedge fund</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"hanson-applied-sciences---smarkets\">Hanson Applied Sciences - Smarkets<a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading icon-link\" href=\"#hanson-applied-sciences---smarkets\"></a></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Position: Quant developer</li>\n<li>Time: June 2022</li>\n<li>Reached Stage: Offer</li>\n<li>Process: Screen chat, Hackerrank (algo + math), Technical Screening (1 algo + 1 ML chats), Final round (went to office,\nHR chat + chats with Team + great lunch!)</li>\n<li>Mistakes: In negotiation stage, when they made me an offer I should have asked <strong>right away</strong> if the offer is negotiable.\nAlways do that, so that you can set expectations for them that you want more. Got in small car/bike accident on the way\nto the interview. Don't put your headphones when driving a bike + be concentrated on the driving when doing it.</li>\n<li>Their business: Market making on sports betting exchanges\nHanson Applied Sciences – is a from Liquidity provider turned to Market Maker\nPart of Smarkets 140 people/ 70 technical staff\nOnline betting\nQuant dev build production code (close to engineering role)\nteam of 3 quant devs graduate, hedge fund guy, sport betting guy\nTech stack Python(quants), Rust (engineers),\nSBK Sports book keeper is a mobile app goes through their other product which is the exchange\nQuant dev is not customer facing – work with engineers</li>\n<li>Pricing engine, lots of microservices, service for post trading analysis, no ML yet, something to be created</li>\n<li>main rival is Betfair.</li>\n<li>Hanson has two jobs make money, make sure all products are prices (provide liquidity).

Key metrics (HEART)\nPresentation talked about ONE project, but could not say whats the final business impact. Overall the 2 Data Science interviews\nwent 50/50 the rest were excellent. Don't interrupt your interviewer! Felt a bit off after the negotiation process. They made\nme good deal and I was hoping to bump a bit more from it, but god bump just 5k.
