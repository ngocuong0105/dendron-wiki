Things to mention:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>select reasons which only the new company has and your old one cannot possibly offer. E.g. relocation in city only the\nnew company has office in, compensation package (e.g 2x)</li>\n<li>say things you like about the team, be specific</li>\n<li>say work-wise what you would do for the transition period. Should be 50/50 split why you leave and work you would do</li>\n<li>ask whether you need to submit resignation letter or other documents</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's all professional, no hard feelings</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Leaving speech, make it as if it is a farewell speech not a leaver</p>\n<p>Mention the people, events and tasks that were most memorable and thank everyone who contributed to making the overall experience enjoyable. If your experiences there led you to a better opportunity, this is also something worth mentioning, as it ensures that you appear grateful for the opportunities you've had. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>what you enjoyed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>feelings about leaving</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>gratitude for support</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>specific examples</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>fun stuff</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Capital One</strong></p>\n<p>Thanks a lot to everybody for coming. I am delighted to see all of you here. Didn't expect so many people to show up, so I am a bit suprised in a nice way of course.</p>\n<p>I've really enjoyed my time here, it's been great to meet all of you. I am glad I was part of Analytics engineering. It's been a fun and interesting experience.</p>\n<p>I want to also thank Gareth and Rob for giving this opporunity. Without you guys, I wouldn't be here so I really appreciate it. I have a lot from both of you and during my time in the team. </p>\n<p>It is still hard for me to believe how you believed in me. The first time I met Rob was on an interview last year and he gave me a very simple math question about calculating some averages. In essense, he asked me something like \" hey Ngo, how much is 1 + 2\" and because I was so nervous during the interview I completely messed up and said 4. The worst part was that 10 second before he gave me the question I told him I got a Masters degree in Maths. At that moment I am not sure if he actually believed me.</p>\n<p>In the end Rob saw something which I am not sure what and gave me the opportunity, so I am very greatful for that. It was definitely a valuable experience which helped me to grow more in my career and an important step for my future endeavours. Without this opporunity I wouldn't be having the other opportunities that I have now.</p>\n<p>It's been a pleasure to work with Johnny, Abhishek and Guoda. Although with Guoda we overlapped for only 1 week because she just joined. But I am sure that you will have some great time here, as I did.</p>","noteIndex":{"id":"wn8PE1RhG0znK1alrGFYv","title":"Root","desc":"","updated":1744237493819,"created":1631901573363,"custom":{"nav_order":0,"permalink":"/"},"fname":"root","type":"note","vault":{"fsPath":"vault"},"contentHash":"ea936af1aea818f3052610daac103a63","links":[],"anchors":{},"children":["dgcsvcwea8scgdegrk9tfni","xig93vo47ou1bkr7s4w1wb2","ro9bbyftsutm88mxw6r16p5","ypia1zmywsklpicmcgrzlz1","w7iitlako61ppm27mym400a","6bx5plramu4hksomqc1n55z","4nki3bedlvs3mnkixj3a07k","9r5ym61dkwap92fvbte1jkq","849u97nrsuyekmr4a1r92ux","2b5bwf46z6v132wu7xghvrp","dygp5h2vzw4mkromwmofynb","7h50s7ga5ziiyblmoctsqmw","pglaolxcge4xfvgoph3je89","uy9u1co5ih1fokind8tg0eq","jc23ggp8iiu92kpnzo721to","f1u2a47guuw70olv36bzf66","c1bs7wsjfbhb0zipaywqv1","2av385tcj2cbumxprsauff3","v77wdzobzcackzimz6a7crv"],"parent":null,"data":{},"body":"\nWelcome to my Knowledge Base!
