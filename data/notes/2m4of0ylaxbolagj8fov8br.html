<p>Steve Jobs graduation speech - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc&#x26;ab_channel=Stanford">youtube</a>.
His three stories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Believe that the dots will connect</li>
</ul>
<p>He was adopted when he was born. Six month in college he had no idea what he was doing and did not see value in it. He decided to attend classes which he was interested in! He stayed in college, just did not study what he had to. Studied calligraphy and was super interested in it. At the time of the study he had no idea how it would help him. 10 years later it came back when designing Mac. Cannot connect the dots looking forward but it all comes back! You need to believe that the dots will connect!</p>
<ul>
<li>Love and loss - Keep looking, don't settle</li>
</ul>
<p>He was fired when he was 30 from his own company. He decided to start over. "Being fired from Apple was one of the best things happened to me." Started his most creative years - founded Next, Pixel, found his wife. The only thing helped him go through this period was that he knew was he loved doing. "You have to believe in your work. In order to believe in your work, you need  to love it. Don't settle!"</p>
<ul>
<li>Death - thinking about death makes you think 'I have noting to loose, follow your heart'</li>
</ul>
<p>"If you live each day as if it's your last, someday you will be right." Look in the mirror and ask yourself "If today is my last day would I do this today." Many 'no-s' in a row means you need to change something.
Death is the destination we all share. Your time is limited, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you want to do - everything else is secondary.</p>

<p>Long term I believe it is very easy to predict lots of successful companies born of the internet - with very large market caps and so on. I also believe that today, it is very hard to predict which are these companies.</p>
<p>If you can focus <strong>obsessively</strong> enough on customer experience, they you would have a good chance.</p>
<p>If it one thing what Amazon is about it is excessive attention to customer experience end-to-end.</p>

<h1 id="oxford">Oxford<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#oxford"></a></h1>
<p>I made lots of mistakes during my 4 years at uni. When I started I thought too much of myself and that I could do whatever I want. Didn't realize that the true work actually started then... I thought I did so much work at highschool and that success was 'v kurpa vurzano'. Kind of wasted first year completely and half of second year. Had some 'love' distractions which affected my study focus and was pretty bad. Basically these 'love' distractions distracted me for nearly 4 years... Super stupid from my side but well, that's it. Now in 2022 I am fully back. I think I got over the love distractions in 100% around March 2020 (covid started and was last year of uni). At that point in time I have 0 in-person and remote contact with the distraction. Felt good. Felt great.</p>
<p>The fact that when talking about my Oxford experience I firstly start rambling about 'love' distractions proves I wasted a fair amount of time there. It is a pity to waste Oxford years like that but whatever.</p>
<p>Main mistake I made during these 4 years is that I did not ave a clear and consistent study plan. I was mainly studying in Hilary and Trinity, skipped lots of classes and lectures and did not have a way to measure my progress. I did not track time/work done in almost any way. And then I got average grades and just complained..</p>
<p>Another mistake is I had some bad influence from toxic people. Should avoid this toxicity as much as possible!</p>
<p>Had a lot of procrastination too</p>
<p>Main mistake is I did not have a plan. Cultural plan, Studying plan, How to live independently plan, healthy lifestyle plan.</p>

<p>It is not expensive (time-wise and money-wise) to become nacepen. You basically pay fixed cost first 2 months to get nacepen,
then you need to pay small regular costs (2,3 times per week). Gym helps me to be more productive when working too. My most efficient work periods have always been when I go to gym regularly too. So it is worth it. Abs is all about diet.</p>

<p>You have underestimated planning and project management. For example when you started using Jira tasks, roadmap, backlog, sprints, these have increased your productivity significantly. Being able to track what you do is super important. Writing things down is highly underappreciated. Writing when and what you achive and seeing it regularly adds lots of value and helps for conistency.</p>

<p>Getting in FAANG has lots of learning value. Will have the chance to learn super many new stuff. Meta publishes papers every week, including in big conferences like NeurIPS.

<h1 id="tc">TC<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#tc"></a></h1>
<p>High TC factors/variables are:</p>
<ul>
<li>interview skills: getting interviews + doing interviews (behaviour + technical)</li>
<li>your skillset and whether you can do the job (this is important but interviewing skills are more important to get high TC)</li>
<li>YOE</li>
<li>market</li>
</ul>
<p>Taka kakto za kasierka davat 2k ne zashtoto izkarva na firmata 2k+, taka v tech plashtat mn pari za gluposti.</p>
<p>Main TC factor is interview skills. It is similar to rising in power in democratic countries. Main skill is marketing/populism and winning elections. Other things such as economics knowldge, finance, politics, leadership, giving speeches, diplomacy are secondary. It is all about winning elections. High TC is all about cracking the interviews.</p>

<p><strong>On job hopping</strong></p>
<p>Job switching requires work which a fair number of people aren't willing to do.
We have all met people who have worked the same job for 10 years etc...</p>
<p>Companies know this and accounting departments have realized that people are willing to exchange the feeling of "comfort" (but not actual job security) of being in the same job for less than market compensation. Its optimizing for people's inertia.</p>
<p>This is why this community exists as it allows us in the industry the tools to collaborate to ensure we make the best TC we can.</p>
<p>This trend of needing to job hop extends far beyond tech and really is the economy as a whole. The boomer mythos of working the same job and showing loyalty to move up is well and thoroughly dead but it's remnants still exist and seep into people's perceptions.</p>
<p>So now that you realize this. Go out there and apply, it's the only way to truly determine your market TC. And take this lesson to heart, you owe companies nothing, it's simply an exchange of your time for more money.</p>

<p>It is  17th of Sept 2024 - Sofia holiday, but also trung thu hah! I can't believe I'm writing these things down. Haven't done actual journaling for a while... I'm a bit lost on what I should be doing. there are a lot of tasks that need to be done, both in personal developement (professional and emotional) and at work.</p>
<p>I've been eating unhealthy the past months. A lot of tupchene and  just can't stop. I am not fat (yet) just about 77-78 kilos. Bought a flat three months ago and was exciting. My problem is that career-wise I haven't improved much. TC is okish at 160K annually and that is good.  But my problem is that the last 2 years there have been little progress both in terms of TC but also in terms of skills/learnings. I found a girl that I like but it is an LDR - kind of sucks. All is good with her and I feel good about it. There are some yellow/red-ish flags but only time will show if my concerns are unnecessary. I think I will give it a chance.</p>
<p>Career-wise, my problem solving abilties are more or less the same as 2 years ago. OMG time flies so fast. I learned a bit of Kaggle, just slightly. Need to get back to speed with competitive programming. </p>
<p>Personal developement: I'm behind on reading lots of books, finance planning.</p>

<p>The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.</p>
<p>There are five basic steps to implementing the technique:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decide on the task to be done</li>
<li>Set the pomodoro timer to n minutes (traditionally 25)</li>
<li>Work on the task until the timer rings; record with an x</li>
<li>Take a short break (3–5 minutes)</li>
<li>After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes)</li>
