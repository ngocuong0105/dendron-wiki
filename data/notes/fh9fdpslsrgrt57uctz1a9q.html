<p><strong>General elections</strong>
A general election is an opportunity for people in every part of the UK to choose their MP - the person who will represent their local area (constituency) in the House of Commons for up to five years.</p>
<p>UK elections: First-past-the post voting system on local level.</p>
<p>UK has 650 constinuencies, each represented by one MP. London has 73 constituencies.</p>
<p><strong>First-past-the-post voting system</strong>: The candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins and becomes the MP for that seat. Usually, the winning candidate would have less than half of the votes (problem of this voting system).</p>
<p>Smaller parties don't stand a chance. Often you can get 15% of the total vote but get only 1 MP.</p>
<p>BG elections: Proportional representation on national level.</p>
