<p>Just be honest about why you are leaving. Things to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>select reasons which only the new company has and your old one cannot possibly offer. E.g. relocation in city only the
new company has office in, compensation package (e.g 2x)</li>
<li>say things you like about the team, be specific</li>
<li>say work-wise what you would do for the transition period. Should be 50/50 split why you leave and work you would do</li>
<li>ask whether you need to submit resignation letter or other documents</li>
</ul>
<p>It's all professional, no hard feelings</p>

If your experiences there led you to a better opportunity, this is also something worth mentioning, as it ensures that you appear grateful for the opportunities you've had. </p>

<p>Thanks a lot to everybody for coming. I am delighted to see all of you here. Didn't expect so many people to show up, so I am a bit suprised in a nice way of course.</p>
<p>I've really enjoyed my time here, it's been great to meet all of you. I am glad I was part of Analytics engineering. It's been a fun and interesting experience.</p>
<p>I want to also thank Gareth and Rob for giving this opporunity. Without you guys, I wouldn't be here so I really appreciate it. I have a lot from both of you and during my time in the team. </p>
<p>It is still hard for me to believe how you believed in me. The first time I met Rob was on an interview last year and he gave me a very simple math question about calculating some averages. In essense, he asked me something like " hey Ngo, how much is 1 + 2" and because I was so nervous during the interview I completely messed up and said 4. The worst part was that 10 second before he gave me the question I told him I got a Masters degree in Maths. At that moment I am not sure if he actually believed me.</p>
<p>In the end Rob saw something which I am not sure what and gave me the opportunity, so I am very greatful for that. It was definitely a valuable experience which helped me to grow more in my career and an important step for my future endeavours. Without this opporunity I wouldn't be having the other opportunities that I have now.</p>
<p>It's been a pleasure to work with Johnny, Abhishek and Guoda. Although with Guoda we overlapped for only 1 week because she just joined. But I am sure that you will have some great time here, as I did.</p>
