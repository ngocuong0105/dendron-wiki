<p>Private methods are those methods which can't be accessed in other class except the class in which they are declared.</p>
<ul>
<li>One underscore is to show it is a internal function: <code>_function_name()</code></li>
<li>Two underscores: the idea is to use double <strong> to fully disclose methods as private so python will convert them form </strong>private_method to _Myclass__my_private_method and will not let a child class overwrite this method. </li>
</ul>
