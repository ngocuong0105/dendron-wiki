# AI

Wow… I just watched a lecture from MIT’s Intro to Deep Learning course, and I can’t believe how much it has evolved over the past five years. It’s honestly mind-blowing. I felt this rush of excitement the entire time — like something clicked. I think this is it. This is what I want to do. ML, DL, AI… this whole world feels like home to me.

It’s crazy to think about how far we’ve come. Back in university, all those concepts felt so abstract — just math and theory. But now? I can literally talk to AI agents. I can generate images with a few lines of code. My computer can speak, understand, and even create. It’s like living in a sci-fi movie, except it’s real.

I feel so inspired. The future feels wide open, and I want to be part of building it. There’s something magical about this field — the pace, the creativity, the impact. I’m dreaming big tonight. I want to learn more, build things, and maybe even teach one day. Who knows?

LLMs does not have the classical DL problem of overfitting. They have other problems..
