<p>Throughput is measured in transactions per second (TPS) or requests per second RPS . It is the amount of information processed, transmitted or stored in a given amount of time.</p>
<p>Latency is measured in milliseconds . It is time it takes a single piece of data to travel from source to destination.</p>
<p>High throughput means the system can handle multiple data at the same time. Low latency means that system can handle single data quickly.</p>
<p><strong>High Throughput, Acceptable Latency</strong>: Batch processing systems (e.g., data ingestion systems) where large volumes of data are processed together, and immediate response is not critical.  </p>
<p><strong>Low Latency, Acceptable Throughput</strong>: Real-time applications (e.g., video conferencing) where rapid responses are more important than processing high volumes of data consistently.</p>
