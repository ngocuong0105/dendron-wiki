<p>From 16th century until the end of WW1, this part of the Middle East was controlled by the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p>It was granted to the British after WW1.</p>
<p>Both Israelis and Palestinians were struggling for self-determination and sovereignty over the territory, developing respective movements for their causes.</p>
<p>Large-scale Jewish immigration followed in succeeding decades, including during Nazi persecution and Holocaust. Both sides continued to assert their right to establish a state.</p>

<p>UK, US, WW2 winners (Антантата) decide to divide the territory between Israelis and Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israel declares independence in May 1948. The next day, a coalition of Arab states, allied with Palestinian factions, attack Israeli forces in what becomes the first of several Arab-Israeli wars. In the end, Israel gains control of an even larger portion of territory — not including the areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. An estimated 700,000 Palestinians flee or are driven from their land in what Palestinians refer to as the “Nakba,” or “catastrophe” in Arabic.</p>
