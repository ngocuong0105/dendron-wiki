<p>Pomodoro means tomatoes in Italian</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a todo-list of tasks you need to finish</li>
<li>Start pomodoro 25 minutes with 5 minutes break</li>
</ol>
<p>Stops you from worrying about the endless tasks you need to finish, and makes you focus on the things you can get done now.</p>
<p>Take 15 minutes at the beginning of your workday (or at the end if you're planning for the next day) to plan out your pomodoros. Take your to-do list for the day and note how many pomodoros each task will take.</p>
<p>Remember, tasks that will take more than 5 pomodoros should be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. Smaller tasks, like responding to emails, can be batched together in a single Pomodoro.</p>
<p>Get away from screen during a break. Coding tasks usually require more time to get into the zone, so you might combine pomodoros.</p>
