<li>Reached Stage: Final Round</li>
<li>Process: Screen chat, Python take home (poker hands), Technical Screening (1 math + 1 sde chats), Final rounds(met 4 people)</li>
<li>Mistakes: Last interview with the CEO (Gavin) could not solve the math question integrate logx... Forgot integration by parts...</li>
<li>Reject reason: stupid math question + not enough finance background. They asked lots of option pricing stuff. Volatility
trading. Black Scholes is wrong.. Implied volatility</li>
<li>Their business: portfolio optimization + compression, greek modelling. very niched business. Rates compression, derivatives,
small company. Swaptionizer, swap on options. Capital Lab is under BGC. optimization problem, loss functions, constraint programming
high paced, entrepreneurial environment,regulations → need for optimization, no regulation = no money for CapitaLab</li>

modularity, maintainability, flexible code, no over engineering. Understand whole business, interact with Front Office.
Main role is in Berlin, there will be all people of the company mainly. Automate management based on scalable technology</li>
<li>Time: June 2022</li>
<li>Reached Stage: Final Round</li>
<li>Process: Screen chat, Hackerrank (algo + pandas), Technical (algorithms with Michael), Final rounds(met whole team )
They did not make me quant dev offer and wanted to interview me for quant research (said bullish on making an offer)</li>
<li>Mistakes: On final round they asked what problems would you expect to have when developing a trading strategy and
implementing it in practice. Quant devs take care of that. Data problem, services, notifications the whole pipeline.
I did not know this stuff.</li>
<li>Reject reason: For QR they asked me about linear regression and how points affect the line. Larger Residuals have larger impact (squared error)... Also the x-axis position of he point matter as well. The farer you are from the mean the larger impact you have on the regression line.</li>
</ul>
<p>Question about optimization problems: Linear regression with beta&#x3C;5 (yes) is that a convex problem. abs(beta) &#x3C; 5 is that a convex problem (no - you might be on the wrong side of the parabola).</p>
<p>Dual problems, how to know you are on global minimum - maximize your dual problem = minimizing your loss</p>
<ul>
<li>Questions: Agile, SQL, Python, Linear regression, Optimization problems</li>
<li>Their business: build renewable energy platform, commodity hedge fund</li>

<li>Process: Screen chat, Hackerrank (algo + math), Technical Screening (1 algo + 1 ML chats), Final round (went to office,
HR chat + chats with Team + great lunch!)</li>
<li>Mistakes: In negotiation stage, when they made me an offer I should have asked <strong>right away</strong> if the offer is negotiable.
Always do that, so that you can set expectations for them that you want more. Got in small car/bike accident on the way
to the interview. Don't put your headphones when driving a bike + be concentrated on the driving when doing it.</li>

<ul>
<li>Position: Product Analyst Merchant</li>
<li>Time: June 2022</li>
<li>Reached Stage: First screening</li>
<li>Reason for reject: Talked with recruiter, Had great interview with product analyst, they have not answered me yet,
I think there is hiring freeze (job ad is gone)</li>
<li>Role: product analyst gives direction of general business. No need to be super statistically rigorous. Write lots of SQL.
Passionate about data. Talked with Haifend Wu in the interview. Shape product in strategic level. Do analysis/metrics, create

<ul>
<li>Position: Data Scientist</li>
<li>Time: June 2022</li>
<li>Reached Stage: Final Round</li>
<li>Process: Screen chat, Hackerrank (SQL + Python), Technical Screening (SQL + DataScience (A/B testing)), final interviews
(Product interview, 1 presentation, 2 Data Science interviews, 1 HR/Leadership chat)</li>
<li>Mistakes: Look for keywords, retention, 2 things to measure in these places user experience and money. Key metrics (HEART)
Presentation talked about ONE project, but could not say whats the final business impact. Overall the 2 Data Science interviews
went 50/50 the rest were excellent. Don't interrupt your interviewer! Felt a bit off after the negotiation process. They made
me good deal and I was hoping to bump a bit more from it, but god bump just 5k. Final offer 120 gbp ~ 160 usd which is good.
However, I felt I could do better and get more money.</li>
<li>Role/Company: Tech Stack: Python, some R, Tableau, AWS for compute and storage, SQL. Role is to work with Multi-local
business (they would be your clients). Unique dataset with lots of interactions</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>1 data chats), Final rounds</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Mistakes: I could not quickly understand the hints during the data interview. It was simple SQL stuff with data table schema.
Algo was leetcode hard and I did it. Communication barrier mistake as I could not get what they meant quickly. Those guys were
data engineers but the feel was like they were traders/pretty sharp, young and quick.</li>
<li>Role/Company: small/productive teams structure, no BA-s, no PM-s, entrepreneurial, OWN-ership, make your own decisions,
fast-paced environment, flat structure, serve quants mostly</li>

<li>Reached Stage: Second technical round</li>
<li>Process: Screen chat, First technical (easy algos), Second technical, Take home, Panel/presentation, CEO chat</li>
<li>Mistakes: Weird interview in Jupyter notebooks, working with datasets. Could not click with interviewer and could not
grasp quickly his ideas. Gave me data which was generated from sin((x-const)/const) + N(0,1) and I had to determine that.
Did some visualization stuff, computed correlations, but did not have a structured way to get the final result so I was slow.
I did not enjoy the experience either. Made mistake not to listen Arlo as I should have. Do not interrupt!</li>
