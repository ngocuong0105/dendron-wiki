<p>Every week I self-reflect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things I did well and am happy about this week.</li>
<li>Imagine your ideal week ahead. What actions do I need to take to make it happen?</li>
<li>What is my biggest waste of time? </li>
<li>Write about a situation that didnâ€™t go as planned. What could you do differently next time?</li>
<li>What relationships did I nurture or neglect?</li>
</ul>
