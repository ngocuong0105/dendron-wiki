<p>Yesterday, we decided to be productive members of society and went to the movies to watch The Sinners. Because nothing says "good life choices" like watching a movie about questionable ones</p>
<p>We then marched over to YiQi, a Pan-Asian restaurant where — get this — every dish came with a little label telling you which country it was from. Because obviously, I need to know the exact coordinates of my ribs before eating them. F*ck those ribs, I loved them. The Pad Thai was good too "tasty but slightly swimming in oil."</p>
<p>To "walk it off," we wandered from Heytea through Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, and along the river near the London Eye. We sat in a random fancy park, took way too many flower photos, and pretended we were influencers. </p>
<p>The highlight? Admiring gum art on Millennium Bridge. Yes, actual chewing gum turned into "art."</p>
