- argue from basic principles
- whatever problem they make you solve argue from the basics
- When you solve problems try to generalize

E.g problem with matching you don't need to consider specific PII info like email, phone, IP,UA, MAIDID. Think about strong and weak indices. Use more general terms.

Problem framing is all about Generalizable Ideas, Generalizable Problem Framing and so on.

Data Quality Score learnings
- argue from basic principles
- functional thinking, map raw data to quality
- probability thinking, 
- add normalizing function to have dqs between 0 and 1, 1/x easiet pu looses interpretability and can lead to very small numbers
- think about expectations, divergence from expected match rate, lol
- expected match rate modeling


- bias vs variance

F1 Score
- precision vs recall
