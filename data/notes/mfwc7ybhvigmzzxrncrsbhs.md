De-extinction! Species that has been extinct for more than 10000 years are brought back to life. These cute little puppies (not puppets) are not only in GoT but in real life, were born somewhere in a lab in the USA. Colossal Biosciences claim to have deciphered the dire wolf genome. They rewrote the genetic code of a common gray wolf to match the dire wolf genome. After careful genetic engineering, Romulus, Remus and baby Khaleesi were born. 

What are dire wolfs? They are bigger, stronger and have larger jaws. Close to monsters. And you don't want to be close to them..

# KISS

Keep It Simple Stupid! Follow this principle in coding, in presenting, in marketing, in sales and in life... In order to convey your message effectively you need to make it simple and understandable!


# Consciousness

The ability to be present, to really understand your surroundings and to be emotionally involved in what is happening. Consciousness is to be considerate, to be kind, to be emotionally intelligent. Be aware and responsive of the external environment around you.

Don't just pretend to listen to other people. Really listen to them, understand what they are saying and debate!

# Leetcoding

Don't fall in the fix test case per test case loop. Sometimes you need to start over... I solved a hard problem that is to find the number of integer less than MAX, such that each digit is less than max_digit. Combinatorial problem where you need to be very precise...
