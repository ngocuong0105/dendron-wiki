## T-strings in python

Template strings in python `t"Insert {user_input}"` would be a generalization of `f-strings`. Often people would use
f-strings in SQL syntax and HTML strings when they should not! These are susceptible to SQL-ingestion attacks. t-strings
will be introduced in python late 2025 and will allow people to access the string components **before** combining
the string and the user input. This will allow developers to do safety checks against malicious user input.
