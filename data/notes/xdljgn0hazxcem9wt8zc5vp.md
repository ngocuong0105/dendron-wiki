- Trump always chickens out
- 2025 Jul 12 Trump extends tariffs negotiates with a month as well
- 3 months ago he would impose tariffs on all countries with trade deficit
- he first announced with a big table all the tariffs, markets went down S&P down 10-15% (almost went 2 years back) - should have bought the dip
- then he said he would negotiate with China and EU, UK and all, and the tariffs would be imposed in 3 months
- now he treated again to impose tariffs but markets are not reacting
