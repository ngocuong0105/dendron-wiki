<ul>
<li>Trump always chickens out</li>
<li>2025 Jul 12 Trump extends tariffs negotiates with a month as well</li>
<li>3 months ago he would impose tariffs on all countries with trade deficit</li>
<li>he first announced with a big table all the tariffs, markets went down S&#x26;P down 10-15% (almost went 2 years back) - should have bought the dip</li>
<li>then he said he would negotiate with China and EU, UK and all, and the tariffs would be imposed in 3 months</li>
<li>now he treated again to impose tariffs but markets are not reacting</li>
