# Fossil fuel = изкопаеми горива

Millions to hundreds of millions of years ago, the remains of plants and animals (such as diatoms) built up in thick layers on the earth’s surface and ocean floors, sometimes mixed with sand, silt, and calcium carbonate. Over time, these layers were buried under sand, silt, and rock. Pressure and heat changed some of this carbon and hydrogen-rich material into coal, some into oil (petroleum), and some into natural gas.

# Coal
Coal is called a fossil fuel because it was made from plants that were once alive! Since coal comes from plants, and plants get their energy from the sun, the
energy in coal also came from the sun. The coal we use today took millions of years to form. We can’t make more in a short time. That is why coal is called nonrenewable.


Burning coal was easier because coal burned longer than wood and, therefore, did not have to be collected as often. People began using coal in the 1800s to
heat their homes. Trains and ships used coal for fuel. Factories used coal to make iron and steel. Today, we burn coal mainly to make electricity.


Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a gas we all produce when we breathe. However, burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy makes a lot of extra CO2. Too much CO2 in the air can trap heat, causing global warming.

Scientists are working on ways to capture CO2 from power plants before it goes into the air. They want to store it deep underground or in the ocean to prevent it from adding to climate change. This process is called carbon capture and storage, or carbon sequestration.

Even though we still use a lot of coal and other fossil fuels for energy, capturing CO2 from power plants could help fight climate change. Scientists are researching these methods to make sure they are safe for the environment, so we can continue using energy without harming our planet.

## Natural Gas
Natural gas forms from ancient buried plants and animals deep underground. It's trapped in rocks and extracted through drilling, providing us with a clean-burning energy source for heating, cooking, and electricity.

What is Natural Gas:
Natural gas is a type of fuel that comes from deep underground. It's made up of gases like methane and is a clean-burning energy source.

Where is it Used:
Natural gas is used in homes for cooking, heating water, and warming houses. It's also used in power plants to generate electricity. Additionally, it's used in some vehicles as a fuel instead of gasoline.

How it's Used:
In homes, natural gas flows through pipelines and is used in stoves and water heaters. Power plants burn it to produce electricity, which powers our homes and businesses. In vehicles, natural gas is stored in special tanks and used as fuel for engines.
