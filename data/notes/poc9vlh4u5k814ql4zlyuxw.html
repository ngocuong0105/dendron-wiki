<p>How do websistes work?
Client (your computer)- ---- Network ------- Server (data base system)</p>
<p>Network = routes packets(data from the server) </p>
<p>Clients and Servers have IP address to find each other</p>
<p>Server send to Client (for client perspestive they get response from server)</p>
<p>What is a server? Server contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU (computetion), </li>
<li>RAM (temporary memory), </li>
<li>Storage data (permanent memory),</li>
<li>Database (structured data)</li>
<li>Network (routers, switch, DNS server)</li>
</ul>
<p>Router forwads pachets between computers in the network
Switch knows where to send these packets in the server.</p>
<p>The cloud gives you all these things above ON DEMAND (scalable).
No need for big servers in data centers and on prem.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>What is Cloud Computing?</li>
</ol>
<p>Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of servers which do the things in prev note.</p>
<p>Allows you to choose the right TYPE and SIZE of computing you need.
Access to these resources Instantly.</p>
<p>AWS owns and maintains the network-connected HARDWARE. You use only the web application.</p>
<p>Cloud Types/Models</p>
<ul>
<li>private cloud (cloud service used by a single organization)</li>
<li>public cloud (service delivered over the Internet)</li>
<li>hybrid cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems solved by the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>time flexibility (instant resource access)</li>
<li>cost-effective (pay as you go)</li>
<li>scalability (no need buy servers and maintain them)</li>
<li>elasticity (scale out and scale in when needed)</li>
<li>availability and fault-tolerance (build across indepenedent data centers)</li>
<li>agility - rapidly develop, test and launch software</li>
</ul>
<p>Managing servers see page 4 picture!:</p>
<p>On prem - care about EVERYTHING</p>
<p>Cloud computing service types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - - care about OS, Runtime,Middleware, Data, Application</li>
<li>Platform as a Service (PaaS) - care about Data, Applications</li>
<li>Software as a Service (SaaS) - just use it</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>IaaS -> Amazon EC2 instance (Virtual machine on AWS)</li>
<li>PaaS -> Heroku, (Elastic Beanstalk on AWS)</li>
<li>SaaS -> (Zoom, Dropbox, Gmail, Rekognition on AWS)</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS services can be any of the cloud computing types.</p>
<p>Pricing on the cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay for compute time</li>
<li>pay for amount of data stored on the cloud</li>
<li>pay for data transfer out of the cloud</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>AWS overview</li>
</ol>
<p>Global infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Regions</li>
<li>AWS Availability zones</li>
<li>AWS Data Centers</li>
<li>AWS Edge Locations/Points of presence</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS Region e.g eu-west-2
A region is a cluster of data centers
Use AWS region close to you to have low latency</p>
<p>AWS services are region scoped! The same service ran in different regions runs it 2 times</p>
<p>How to choose AWS region?</p>
<ul>
<li>compliance (data govenrnance and legal requirements)</li>
<li>proximity (low latency)</li>
<li>available services in region</li>
<li>pricing in region</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS zones are SUBSET of AWS regions. AWS zone = AWS availability zone is one or more discrete data centers with their own power, networking and connectivity</p>
<p>Shared responsibility Model
Customer is responsible for the security IN the cloud
AWS is responsible for the security OF the cloud</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>IAM = Identity and Access Management global service</li>
</ol>
<p>Provides access control across all of AWS.
With IAM you can specify who can access which services and resources.</p>
<p>IAM policies you manage permissions to other people.
Access is denied by default and is granted only if you specify Allow.</p>
<p>Root account is created by default when you register in AWS.
Should NOT be shared or used when developing applications.</p>
<p>How users access AWS:</p>
<ul>
<li>AWS Management Console (screen on the web app - protected by password + MFA(optional))</li>
<li>AWS CLI (protected by access keys)</li>
<li>AWS SDK (for code protected by access keys)</li>
</ul>
<p>Access keys are like passsowrds generated through the AWS Console (screen on the web app)</p>
<p>An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users.
User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users.</p>
<p>E.g. For a group called Admins  any user in that user group automatically has Admins group permissions</p>
<p>An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions.
IAM role vs IAM groups
Short answer for googlers: you can't assign role to user but can assign group to user.
group is a bunch of users with the same policies
role is a preset of policies for service(s)</p>
<p>Best practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>dont use root account except for AWS account setup</li>
<li>One physical user = One AWS user</li>
<li>assign users t groups and assign permissions to groups</li>
<li>never share IAM users and access keys</li>
<li>Audit permissions of you account with the IAM credentials report</li>
</ul>
<ol start="6">
<li>Amazon EC2 = Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud = Virtual machine</li>
</ol>
<p>Amazon EC2 is a service allowing you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>rent virtual machines (EC2 instances)</li>
<li>storing data on virtual drives (EBS = elastic block storage)</li>
<li>distribution across machines (ELB = elastic load balancing)</li>
<li>scaliing services using auto-scaling group (ASG)</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS EC2 is about renting compute/memory on demand (basically what AWS is about).</p>
