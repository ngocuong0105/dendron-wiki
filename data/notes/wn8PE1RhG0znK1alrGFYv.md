Welcome to my Knowledge Base! Here I write about my perception of life, document exciting things I've learned, debate (with myself) on controversial topics. If you know me you will not be surprised to find out that I write mostly about engineering and maths. Other topics I'm interested in are economics, politics, business, chess and poker.
