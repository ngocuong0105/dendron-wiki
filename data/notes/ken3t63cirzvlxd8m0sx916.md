# Sinners

Yesterday, we decided to be productive members of society and went to the movies to watch The Sinners. Because nothing says "good life choices" like watching a movie about questionable ones

We then marched over to YiQi, a Pan-Asian restaurant where — get this — every dish came with a little label telling you which country it was from. Because obviously, I need to know the exact coordinates of my ribs before eating them. F*ck those ribs, I loved them. The Pad Thai was good too "tasty but slightly swimming in oil."

To "walk it off," we wandered from Heytea through Piccadilly Circus, Trafalgar Square, and along the river near the London Eye. We sat in a random fancy park, took way too many flower photos, and pretended we were influencers. 

The highlight? Admiring gum art on Millennium Bridge. Yes, actual chewing gum turned into "art."
