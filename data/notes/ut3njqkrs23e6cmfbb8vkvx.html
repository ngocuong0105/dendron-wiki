<p><strong>The business of financial institutions is the handling of money.</strong></p>
<p>City of London is the heart of the UK financial system. The primary function f this system is to connect people who lend with people who want to borrow. Financial institutions are middle men. Their job is the job of <strong>handling money</strong>.</p>
<p>Why do we need middle men? Often the needs of borrowers cannot be matched by lenders. Borrowers such as governments and companies need large sums of money, lenders usually lend small amounts. Also lenders often want to withdraw their money quickly. Companies need money for longer periods of time. People with mortgages want to borrow for the next 25 years.</p>
<p>Two variables when lending money:</p>
<ul>
<li>time to return/withdraw (related to liquidity)</li>
<li>amount (related to liquidity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Borrowers:</p>
<ul>
<li>businesses - using shares</li>
<li>governments - using bonds</li>
</ul>
<p>Lenders (need to be net savers)</p>
<ul>
<li>private people</li>
<li>working class</li>
</ul>
<p>Middle man:</p>
<ul>
<li>banks</li>
<li>building societies</li>
<li>pension schemes</li>
<li>life insurances</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Money is just one of the many financial assets.</strong> What distinguishes all financial assets is their liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>Greater risk demands greater reward.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lesser liquidity demands greater reward.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loans.</strong>Extra returns come from interest rate.</li>
<li><strong>Bonds</strong>. Loan from government which you can choose to be paid back at expiry or you can trade it before expiry. Bond also pay interest rate called coupons,</li>
<li><strong>Equities = Shares</strong>. Loan which you would never be returned but you can trade. May receive dividends (small interest rate), Rely solely on growth.</li>
</ul>
<p>If company goes south, lenders and bondholders come first and then equity investors. However in case of growth, equity investors benefit more.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Derivatives</strong> are financial assets that are based on other products; their value is derived from elsewhere. Among the best-known derivative instruments are futures, options and swaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leverage</strong> gives the investor an opportunity for a large profit with a small stake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Liquidity range: The range of financial assets extends from cash to long-term loans.</p>
<h1 id="the-international-financial-revolution">The International Financial Revolution<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#the-international-financial-revolution"></a></h1>
<p>Old system - Bretton Woods had fixed exchange rates with strict controls on capital flows. This system went down in 1970s. Sterling was moved to floating point with the US dollar.</p>
<p>Floating exchange rates added risks for companies trading worldwide. This was opportunity for financial companies to mitigate foreign-exchange rate.</p>
<p>There are 3 elements of monetary policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>exchange rates</li>
<li>interest rates</li>
<li>capital controls</li>
</ul>
<p>Under Bretton Woods system, countries controlled their exchange rates and capital flows.</p>
<p><em>The absence of takeovers meant there was no market discipline on poor companies to perform well.</em></p>
<p>The free-market model: lower taxes, reduced government deficits and open capital markets.</p>
<p><strong>Globalization</strong></p>
<p>What is globalization? It is one of those terms that is often used, but more rarely defined. Broadly
speaking, it is a trend whereby trade, investment and culture have become ever more international.</p>

<p>There are a variety of functions which money serves:</p>
<ul>
<li>measure of value</li>
<li>store of value (can be saved until needed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Creditors will accept money as a future payment, confident that its value will remain stable in the meantime.</p>
<p>Barter system (goat for cow) -> Gold and Silver -> Paper money.</p>
<p>Why change from gold to paper money?</p>
<ul>
<li>Supplies of gold and silver were outstripped by the demands of society.</li>
<li>Bad money drives out good. People with pure gold would strip it out a bit. Only worst coins circulated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="banknotes-and-cheques">Banknotes and Cheques<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#banknotes-and-cheques"></a></h2>
<p>Banknotes were, in origin, claims on gold and silver.</p>
<p>Now money depends on the confidence of its users in the strength of the economy.</p>
<p>Banknotes, Cheques, Cash, Credit and Debit cards. The system depends on the confidence of all those concerned.</p>
<p>Bank accounts are therefore money in the same sense as notes and coins are, since they can be used instantly to purchase goods.</p>

<h2 id="interest-rates">Interest rates<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#interest-rates"></a></h2>
<p><strong>Interest rate is essentially the price of money</strong></p>
<p>The price is paid by the borrower in return for the use of the lender â€™s money. The lender is compensated for not having the use of his money.</p>
<ul>
<li>simple</li>
<li>compound</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="yield">Yield<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading icon-link" href="#yield"></a></h2>
<p>When dealing with a bond or with a share, it is more important to talk of the yield than merely of the interest rate or dividend.</p>
<p>The interest rate or dividend, expressed as a percentage of the price of the asset, is the yield</p>
