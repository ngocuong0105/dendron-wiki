Every week I self-reflect:
- Things I did well and am happy about this week.
- Imagine your ideal week ahead. What actions do I need to take to make it happen?
- What is my biggest waste of time? 
- Write about a situation that didnâ€™t go as planned. What could you do differently next time?
- What relationships did I nurture or neglect?
